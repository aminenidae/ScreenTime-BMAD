# Build Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. LAError Case Comparison Error
**File:** AuthenticationService.swift
**Lines:** 43, 45, 47

**Problem:** 
The code was directly comparing LAError enum cases (`.userCancel`, `.biometryNotAvailable`, `.biometryNotEnrolled`) instead of comparing their `code` property.

**Error Messages:**
- Member 'userCancel' in 'LAError' produces result of type 'LAError.Code', but context expects 'LAError'
- Member 'biometryNotAvailable' in 'LAError' produces result of type 'LAError.Code', but context expects 'LAError'
- Member 'biometryNotEnrolled' in 'LAError' produces result of type 'LAError.Code', but context expects 'LAError'

**Fix Applied:**
Changed `switch laError` to `switch laError.code` to properly compare the error codes.

### 2. Exhaustive Switch Warning
**File:** AuthenticationService.swift
**Line:** 76

**Problem:**
The switch statement for `context.biometryType` was not exhaustive. It was missing the `.opticID` case introduced in newer iOS versions.

**Warning Message:**
- Switch must be exhaustive
- Add missing case: '.opticID'

**Fix Applied:**
Added the missing `.opticID` case and treated it similar to `.faceID`.

## Verification

These fixes should resolve all the build errors in the current build log. The AuthenticationService should now compile successfully.
