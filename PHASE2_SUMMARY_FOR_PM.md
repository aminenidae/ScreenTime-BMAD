## Overview

Phase 2 of the User Session Implementation Plan has been successfully completed. This phase focused on implementing the Mode Selection UI that allows users to choose between Parent Mode (protected) and Child Mode (open access).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ModeSelectionView.swift
- Created a new view with dual-mode selection interface
- Implemented Parent Mode button with biometric authentication trigger
- Implemented Child Mode button for direct access
- Added visual feedback during authentication process
- Integrated error handling for authentication failures
- Designed responsive UI with appropriate styling

### 2. ScreenTimeRewardsApp.swift Update
- Updated the app's entry point to show ModeSelectionView first
- Implemented conditional navigation based on session mode
- Integrated SessionManager as environment object
- Maintained existing MainTabView for Parent Mode
- Prepared structure for ChildModeView (to be implemented in Phase 3)

## Key Features

### User Experience
- Clear visual distinction between Parent and Child modes
- Intuitive interface with descriptive labels
- Appropriate feedback during authentication
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Technical Implementation
- Proper integration with SessionManager for state management
- Conditional navigation based on current mode
- Environment object passing to child views
- SwiftUI best practices for layout and styling

## Testing Results

All acceptance criteria have been met:
- ✅ Mode selection view appears on launch
- ✅ Parent mode button triggers authentication
- ✅ Child mode button navigates immediately
- ✅ Error messages display correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 3:** Implement Child Mode Views
   - Create ChildModeView and ChildDashboardView
   - Add filtering logic to AppUsageViewModel

2. **Phase 4:** Implement Parent Mode Integration
   - Create ParentModeContainer
   - Add authentication guard
   - Implement "Exit Parent Mode" functionality

## Files Created/Modified

- **New:** `/Views/ModeSelectionView.swift`
- **Modified:** `/ScreenTimeRewardsApp.swift`

## Impact

With this implementation, users will now see the mode selection screen when they launch the app, allowing them to choose between Parent Mode (with authentication) and Child Mode (direct access). This completes the foundation for the dual-user profile system.
