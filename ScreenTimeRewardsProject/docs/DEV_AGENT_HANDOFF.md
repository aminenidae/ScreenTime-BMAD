# Dev Agent Handoff Document

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**From:** PM (Claude)
**To:** Dev Agent
**Project:** ScreenTime Rewards - Cross-Account Pairing Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

**What:** Implement CloudKit private database sharing for cross-account device pairing
**Why:** Child device pairs successfully but parent cannot see child (different iCloud accounts)
**How:** Use CKShare to give child write access to parent's shared zone
**When:** Estimated 4-6 hours implementation time
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocking feature completion

---

## Current State

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Local Pairing Handshake**
   - Parent generates QR code (instant)
   - Child scans QR code (works reliably)
   - Child saves parent device ID locally
   - No permission errors during pairing

2. **Device Registration**
   - Both devices register in own CloudKit databases
   - Core Data + CloudKit sync working
   - NSPersistentCloudKitContainer configured correctly

3. **Infrastructure**
   - All CloudKit services implemented
   - Offline queue manager operational
   - Push notifications registered
   - Core Data models with CloudKit attributes

### ❌ What's Broken

**Problem:** Parent cannot see child device after pairing

**Root Cause:**
```
Child Device → Writes to Child's Private DB → CloudKit syncs to Child's account
Parent Device → Queries Parent's Private DB → Can't see Child's account data
Result: Parent dashboard shows "No linked devices"
```

**Why This Happens:**
- Each iCloud account has isolated private CloudKit database
- No cross-account access permitted by Apple
- Need to use CloudKit sharing to bridge accounts

---

## The Solution

### Architecture Change

**Before (Current - Broken):**
```
Parent Private DB        Child Private DB
├─ Parent's data        ├─ Child's data ✓
└─ (empty)              └─ RegisteredDevice ✓

Parent queries own DB → Finds nothing ❌
```

**After (Target - Fixed):**
```
Parent Private DB (with Shared Zone)
├─ Parent's data
└─ Shared Zone: "ChildMonitoring-{UUID}"
   ├─ MonitoringSession (root)
   ├─ CKShare (grants write access)
   └─ RegisteredDevice ✓ (written by child)

Parent queries own DB → Finds child device ✅
```

### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Parent Creates Share**
```swift
// Create zone + root record + CKShare in parent's private DB
let (zone, share) = try await createMonitoringZoneForChild()
// QR code now contains share.url
```

**Step 2: Child Accepts Share**
```swift
// Child accepts share from QR code
try await container.accept(shareMetadata)
// Child gains write access to parent's shared zone
```

**Step 3: Child Registers in Parent's Zone**
```swift
// Child writes to sharedCloudDatabase (view of parent's zone)
try await sharedCloudDatabase.save(deviceRecord)
// Record appears in parent's private database immediately
```

**Step 4: Parent Queries Own Database**
```swift
// Parent queries privateCloudDatabase (includes shared zones)
let results = try await privateCloudDatabase.records(matching: query)
// Sees child's device record ✅
```

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Understand the Problem (5 min)

**Try this test:**
```bash
# On child device console, look for:
[CloudKit] Device Type: child
[CloudKit] Parent Device ID: B3A9DCB9-BA14-46DC-89EE-E49A3D787AC8

# On parent device console, look for:
[CloudKitSyncService] Found 0 child device(s) in local database

# Why 0? Because child wrote to DIFFERENT database!
```

### 2. Read Task List (15 min)

Open `docs/DEV_AGENT_TASKS.md` and read Tasks 1-5.
Focus on Task 1 first - it's the foundation.

### 3. Research CKShare (30 min)

**Key Question to Answer:**
How do I configure CKShare to allow anonymous participants to WRITE?

**Hint:** The answer might be one of:
- `share.publicPermission = .readWrite`
- Add explicit participant with write permission
- Configure share differently for private sharing

**Where to Look:**
- Apple's CloudKit sharing documentation
- WWDC session code samples
- CloudKit Dashboard (inspect shares manually created)

### 4. Implement Task 1 (1-2 hours)

Create the zone + share creation function.
Test by checking CloudKit Dashboard.
Verify share has valid URL.

### 5. Continue Through Tasks 2-5 (2-3 hours)

Follow the task list sequentially.
Test after each task.
Update checkboxes as you complete them.

### 6. End-to-End Test (30 min)

- Parent generates QR with share URL
- Child scans and accepts share
- Child registers in parent's zone
- Parent refreshes dashboard
- **Success:** Child device appears!

- Current state: Calls old local pairing function

### Supporting Files

**5. PairingPayload struct** (in DevicePairingService.swift)
- Add field: `sharedZoneID: String?`
- Stores zone name for child to use

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Test Each Function

**Test 1: Zone Creation**
```swift
let (zone, share) = try await createMonitoringZoneForChild()
XCTAssertNotNil(share.url)
XCTAssertEqual(zone.zoneID.zoneName.hasPrefix("ChildMonitoring-"), true)
```

**Test 2: Share Acceptance**
```swift
try await acceptParentShareAndRegister(from: payload)
// Should not throw
```

**Test 3: Device Registration**
```swift
// Check CloudKit Dashboard for CD_RegisteredDevice in parent's zone
```

### Integration Test

**Full Pairing Flow:**
1. Parent: Generate QR code
2. Child: Scan QR code
3. Verify: No errors in console
4. Parent: Refresh dashboard
5. Verify: Child device appears

**Expected Console Output:**
```
[DevicePairingService] ✅ Zone created: ChildMonitoring-{UUID}
[DevicePairingService] ✅ Share created with URL: ...
[DevicePairingService] ✅ Share accepted
[DevicePairingService] ✅ Child registered in parent's zone
[CloudKitSyncService] Found 1 child device(s)  ← SUCCESS!
```

### Manual Test with CloudKit Dashboard

**After each step, check Dashboard:**

**Step 1 (Parent creates share):**
- Navigate to parent's CloudKit account
- Find zone: "ChildMonitoring-{UUID}"
- Verify: MonitoringSession record exists
- Verify: CKShare record exists with URL

**Step 3 (Child registers):**
- Still in parent's CloudKit account
- Same zone: "ChildMonitoring-{UUID}"
- Verify: CD_RegisteredDevice record exists
- Check: deviceType = "child", deviceID matches child

## Common Issues & How to Fix

### Issue 1: "WRITE operation not permitted"

**Symptom:**
```
[DevicePairingService] ❌ CloudKit error: <CKError 0x...: "Permission Failure" (10/2007)
```

**Diagnosis:**
Share doesn't have write permissions for participants.

**Solutions to Try:**
1. Check `share.publicPermission` is set to `.readWrite`
2. If that doesn't work, try adding explicit participant
3. Research: CloudKit private share write permissions
4. Check: Are we writing to correct database (sharedCloudDatabase)?

**How to Verify Fix:**
- Manually create share in CloudKit Dashboard with write permissions
- Test child write - should succeed
- Compare your code to manual settings

---

### Issue 2: Query returns 0 devices (still)

**Symptom:**
```
[CloudKitSyncService] Found 0 child device(s)
```

**Diagnosis Checklist:**
- [ ] Did child actually write to shared zone? (Check Dashboard)
- [ ] Is parent querying privateCloudDatabase? (not sharedCloudDatabase)
- [ ] Is query predicate correct?
- [ ] Is child record in parent's account? (Check Dashboard carefully)

**How to Debug:**
```swift
// Add logging to parent query
print("Querying database: \(database)")
print("Predicate: \(predicate)")
print("Results: \(matchResults.count)")

// Log each result
for (recordID, result) in matchResults {
    print("Record: \(recordID)")
}
```

---

### Issue 3: Share URL is nil

**Symptom:**
```
guard let shareURL = share.url else { ... }  // nil!
```

**Cause:**
Share not saved to CloudKit yet, URL not generated.

**Fix:**
```swift
// Save share FIRST
let savedShare = try await database.save(share)
// NOW url is available
let url = savedShare.url  // ✅
```

---

### Issue 4: "Unknown Item" - Record type not found

**Symptom:**
```
<CKError ...: "Unknown Item" (11/2003)>
```

**Cause:**
Querying for record type that doesn't exist in schema OR querying wrong database.

**Fix:**
- Verify record type name exactly matches: "CD_RegisteredDevice"
- Verify querying correct database
- Check CloudKit Dashboard for actual record type names

---

## Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. CloudKit Databases (Critical!)

**Three databases, different purposes:**

```swift
// Private Database
let privateDB = container.privateCloudDatabase
// - Stores user's private data
// - Includes shared zones (when user is owner)
// - Parent queries this to see child's data

// Shared Database
let sharedDB = container.sharedCloudDatabase
// - View of zones shared TO this user
// - Child writes here to put data in parent's zone
// - NOT where parent queries!

// Public Database
let publicDB = container.publicCloudDatabase
// - Read-only for regular users
// - NOT USED in our solution
```

**Parent's View:**
```
privateCloudDatabase
├─ Own data (zones you created)
└─ Shared zones (zones others shared to you)
```

**Child's View:**
```
sharedCloudDatabase
└─ Zones shared TO me (parent's zone)
```

### 2. CKShare Flow

**Creation (Parent):**
```swift
// 1. Create root record
let root = CKRecord(recordType: "MonitoringSession", recordID: rootID)

// 2. Create share FROM root record
let share = CKShare(rootRecord: root)

// 3. Save BOTH together
try await db.save([root, share])

// 4. Share URL now available
let url = share.url  // Put in QR code
```

**Acceptance (Child):**
```swift
// 1. Get URL from QR code
let url = URL(string: payload.shareURL)

// 2. Fetch metadata
let metadata = try await container.fetchShareMetadata(with: url)

// 3. Accept share
try await container.accept(metadata)

// 4. Now can write to shared zone
```

### 3. Zone IDs

**Important:** Zone ID comes from share metadata!

```swift
// After accepting share:
let sharedZoneID = metadata.rootRecordID.zoneID

// Use this zone ID when creating records:
let recordID = CKRecord.ID(recordName: "device-...", zoneID: sharedZoneID)
let record = CKRecord(recordType: "CD_RegisteredDevice", recordID: recordID)

// Save to SHARED database (child's view)
try await sharedCloudDatabase.save(record)
```

4. Child taps "Scan QR Code" → scans parent's QR
5. Child sees "Pairing successful!" alert
6. Parent taps refresh button on dashboard
7. **Parent sees child device with name "Imane" (or actual child name)**
8. Parent sees device status: Active

**If all steps work → Feature complete! 🎉**

## Communication Protocol

### While Working:

**Update `DEV_AGENT_TASKS.md`:**
- Check off completed tasks
- Add notes about issues encountered
- Document solutions to unexpected problems

**If Stuck >2 Hours:**
- Document what you tried
- What error messages you see
- What research you've done
- Ask for help (PM will respond)

### When Complete:

**Create summary document:**
- What you implemented
- What tested scenarios pass
- Any known issues or limitations
- Recommendations for next steps

---

## Additional Context

### Why Cross-Account Matters

**User Story:**
"As a parent, I want to monitor my child's iPad usage from my iPhone, where my child and I have separate iCloud accounts."

**Why Separate Accounts:**
- Privacy (child has own photos, messages, etc.)
- App purchases (separate purchases/subscriptions)
- Family Sharing (Apple's recommended setup)
- Security (separate passwords)

**This is the PRIMARY use case!** Same-account is easy but not realistic.

### Project Background

- Project started October 2025
- Phase 0-3: Device mode, local features (complete)
- Phase 4-5: Remote monitoring via CloudKit (in progress)
- This task: Final blocker for Phase 4 completion

### What Happens After This

**Immediate Next:**
- Usage data sync (child sends data to parent)
- Parent configuration push (parent configures child remotely)

**Uses Same Architecture:**
- Child writes UsageRecords to parent's shared zone
- Parent writes AppConfiguration to shared zone
- Both query as needed

**So get this right and the rest follows easily!**
