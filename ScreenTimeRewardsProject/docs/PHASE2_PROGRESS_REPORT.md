# Phase 2 Progress Report
## CloudKit Sync Service Implementation

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** Complete

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing Phase 2: CloudKit Sync Service as outlined in the development roadmap.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 2.1: Implement Full CloudKitSyncService
- Created additional methods for parent-child communication
- Implemented conflict resolution strategies
- Added comprehensive error handling

**Methods Implemented:**

#### Parent Device Methods:
- [x] `fetchLinkedChildDevices()`
- [x] `fetchChildUsageData(deviceID:dateRange:)`
- [x] `fetchChildDailySummary(deviceID:date:)`
- [x] `sendConfigurationToChild(deviceID:configuration:)`
- [x] `requestChildSync(deviceID:)`

#### Child Device Methods:
- [x] `downloadParentConfiguration()`
- [x] `uploadUsageRecords(_:)`
- [x] `uploadDailySummary(_:)`
- [x] `markConfigurationCommandExecuted(_:)`

#### Common Methods:
- [x] `handlePushNotification(userInfo:)`
- [x] `forceSyncNow()`
- [x] `processOfflineQueue()`

#### Conflict Resolution:
- [x] `resolveConflict(local:remote:)`
- [x] `mergeConfigurations(local:remote:)`

### ✅ Task 2.2: Implement Push Notification Setup
- Created [AppDelegate.swift](file:///Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/AppDelegate.swift)
- Implemented push notification registration
- Added remote notification handling
- Integrated with CloudKitSyncService

### ✅ Task 2.3: Implement Offline Queue System
- Created [OfflineQueueManager.swift](file:///Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Services/OfflineQueueManager.swift)
- Implemented queue operations with retry logic
- Added queue processing functionality

### ✅ Task 2.4: Implement Conflict Resolution
Conflict resolution methods have been implemented and integrated with sync operations.

### ✅ Task 2.5: Integrate with ScreenTimeService
- Created [ScreenTimeService+CloudKit.swift](file:///Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService+CloudKit.swift)
- Implemented `syncConfigurationToCloudKit()` method
- Implemented `applyCloudKitConfiguration(_:)` method
- Added helper methods for token mapping and app management

## Files Created

1. **AppDelegate.swift** - New file with push notification handling
2. **Services/OfflineQueueManager.swift** - New file with offline queue functionality
3. **Services/CloudKitSyncService.swift** - Expanded with full implementation
4. **ScreenTimeRewardsApp.swift** - Modified to use AppDelegate
5. **Services/ScreenTimeService+CloudKit.swift** - New file with CloudKit integration extension

## Next Steps

1. **Proper Test Setup** - Follow the UNIT_TESTING_SETUP_GUIDE.md to properly integrate tests in Xcode
2. **Comprehensive Testing** - Conduct thorough testing across multiple devices

## Testing

Unit test templates were created for the core functionality but need proper Xcode integration:
- CloudKitSyncService conflict resolution
- OfflineQueueManager operations
- Configuration merging logic

See [UNIT_TESTING_SETUP_GUIDE.md](file:///Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/ScreenTimeRewardsProject/docs/UNIT_TESTING_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for instructions on setting up tests correctly.

## Issues/Concerns

1. **Core Data Model Files** - The NSManagedObject subclasses may need to be regenerated after the Core Data model updates
2. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing requires multiple devices with different iCloud accounts

## Recommendations

1. Regenerate NSManagedObject subclasses if needed
2. Follow the UNIT_TESTING_SETUP_GUIDE.md to properly set up tests in Xcode
3. Prepare for integration testing with multiple devices
