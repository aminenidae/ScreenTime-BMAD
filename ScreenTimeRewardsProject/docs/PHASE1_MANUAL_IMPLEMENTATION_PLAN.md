# Phase 1 Manual Implementation Plan

This document outlines the manual steps required to complete Phase 1 of the CloudKit Remote Monitoring Implementation.

## Overview

Phase 1 requires some manual intervention in Xcode that cannot be automated. This plan details those steps and provides guidance for completing them.

## Manual Tasks Required

### Task 1: Core Data Model Update
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Required By:** Developer with Xcode access

#### Steps:
1. Follow the instructions in `XCODE_CORE_DATA_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`
2. Update the `.xcdatamodeld` file with all 6 entities
3. Generate NSManagedObject subclasses
4. Verify CloudKit compatibility settings

#### Verification:
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] All entities created with correct attributes
- [ ] Indexed attributes properly marked
- [ ] NSManagedObject subclasses generated
- [ ] CloudKit syncable option enabled for all entities

### Task 2: Xcode Project Capability Configuration
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Required By:** Developer with Xcode access

#### Steps:
1. Open project in Xcode
2. Select target "ScreenTimeRewards"
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
4. Verify "iCloud" capability is added with CloudKit enabled
5. Verify container identifier is `iCloud.com.screentimerewards`
6. Verify "Push Notifications" capability is added
7. Verify "Background Modes" are configured:
   - Background fetch
   - Remote notifications
   - Background processing

#### Verification:
- [ ] All capabilities properly configured
- [ ] No warnings or errors in Signing & Capabilities
- [ ] Entitlements file correctly updated

## Prerequisites for Next Phase

Before proceeding to Phase 2, the following must be completed:

1. [ ] Core Data model updated with all entities
2. [ ] NSManagedObject subclasses generated
3. [ ] Xcode project capabilities verified
4. [ ] Basic CloudKit functionality tested

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Device Registration Test**
   - Launch app on Device A
   - Register as Parent Device
   - Verify RegisteredDevice entity created locally
   - Wait for CloudKit sync
   - Launch app on Device B
   - Register as Child Device
   - Verify both devices appear in CloudKit dashboard

2. **Basic Sync Test**
   - Create test data on one device
   - Verify it appears on other devices
   - Test both parent and child device scenarios

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for CloudKitDebugService
- [ ] Unit tests for CloudKitSyncService
- [ ] Integration tests for persistence layer

## Dependencies

- Phase 0 must be fully completed
- Xcode 12.0 or later required
- iCloud account for testing
- Multiple devices for cross-device testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Core Data model changes can break existing functionality if not done carefully
- CloudKit configuration errors can cause sync failures

### Medium Risk
- Incorrect indexing can impact performance
- Missing capabilities can cause runtime errors

### Low Risk
- Documentation may become outdated if Xcode UI changes

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Backup Before Changes**
   - Create a git commit before making Core Data changes
   - Backup the project folder

2. **Incremental Implementation**
   - Add entities one at a time
   - Test after each addition

3. **Thorough Testing**
   - Test on multiple devices
   - Verify both online and offline scenarios

4. **Documentation**
   - Keep documentation updated with any changes
   - Note any deviations from the plan

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Project builds without errors
- [ ] All Core Data entities created and functional
- [ ] CloudKit sync working between devices
- [ ] Debug tools functional
- [ ] Basic sync test passes
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Proceed to Phase 2: CloudKit Sync Service
2. Implement full CloudKitSyncService functionality
3. Add push notification handling
4. Implement offline queue system
5. Add conflict resolution strategies
6. Conduct comprehensive integration testing
