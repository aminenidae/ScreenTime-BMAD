## Summary

Phase 1 of the User Session Implementation has been successfully completed. This phase focused on creating the foundational components required for implementing the Parent and Child mode feature in the ScreenTime Rewards application.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. SessionManager.swift
- Created in `/Services/` directory
- Implements `UserMode` enum with cases for `.none`, `.parent`, and `.child`
- Provides `@Published` properties for tracking current mode and authentication state
- Includes session lifecycle methods:
  - `enterParentMode(authenticated:)`
  - `enterChildMode()`
  - `exitToSelection()`
  - `requiresReAuthentication()`

### 2. AuthenticationService.swift
- Created in `/Services/` directory
- Integrates with Apple's LocalAuthentication framework
- Implements biometric authentication (FaceID/TouchID) with PIN fallback
- Provides methods for:
  - `authenticate(reason:completion:)`
  - `canAuthenticateWithBiometrics()`
  - `biometricType()`
- Handles various authentication error scenarios gracefully

### 3. AuthError.swift
- Created in `/Models/` directory
- Defines specific authentication error types:
  - `notAvailable`
  - `authenticationFailed`
  - `userCancel`
  - `biometryNotAvailable`
  - `biometryNotEnrolled`
- Implements user-friendly error descriptions for each error type

## Technical Details

### Architecture
All new components follow the existing project architecture patterns:
- Services are implemented as classes with clear responsibilities
- Models are implemented as value types (enums/structs)
- Proper separation of concerns between authentication logic and session management

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling for all authentication scenarios:
- Device without biometric capabilities
- User cancellation of authentication
- Failed authentication attempts
- Biometric not enrolled on device

### Debug Support
All components include debug logging that can be enabled in DEBUG builds without affecting production performance.

## Next Steps

The foundation is now in place for implementing:
1. Mode selection UI
2. Child mode dashboard
3. Parent mode authentication wrapper
4. Integration with existing application features

## Verification

All created files have been verified for:
- Proper Swift syntax
- Correct import statements
- Adherence to project coding standards
- No compilation errors

The implementation is ready for the next phase of development.
