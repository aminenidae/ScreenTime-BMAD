## Architecture

### Design Pattern
**MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
- **Models**: `AppUsage`, `AppCategory`
- **Views**: `MainTabView`, `LearningTabView`, `RewardsTabView`, `CategoryAssignmentView`
- **ViewModels**: `AppUsageViewModel`
- **Services**: `ScreenTimeService`

### Data Flow
```
User Action → View → ViewModel → Service → Apple Frameworks
                ↓                    ↓
            UI Update ← Notifications ← Framework Callbacks
```

### Apple Frameworks Used
1. **FamilyControls**: App selection picker, authorization
2. **ManagedSettings**: App blocking (shielding)
3. **DeviceActivity**: Usage monitoring, event tracking
4. **SwiftUI**: Modern UI framework
5. **Combine**: Reactive data flow

---

## Implemented Features

### 1. Two-Tab Interface

**File**: `MainTabView.swift`
- Tab 1: Learning (Blue theme, book icon)
- Tab 2: Rewards (Orange theme, game controller icon)
- Entry point for the entire app

**Purpose**: Clear separation between earning and spending mechanics

---

### 2. Learning Tab

**File**: `LearningTabView.swift`

**Features**:
- Display total points earned from learning
- Show learning time formatted as HH:MM:SS
- List all selected learning apps with:
  - App name/icon (iOS 15.2+)
  - Points earned per minute
- **Buttons**:
  - "Select Learning Apps" / "Add More Apps" - Opens app picker
  - "View All Learning Apps" - Opens CategoryAssignmentView to see all apps
- Auto-categorization: All apps → `AppCategory.learning`

**Key Code Locations**:
```
LearningTabView.swift:25-36  → Total points display
LearningTabView.swift:44-78  → App list
LearningTabView.swift:97-112 → View All button
LearningTabView.swift:113-126 → CategoryAssignmentView integration
```

---

### 3. Rewards Tab

**File**: `RewardsTabView.swift`

**Features**:
- List all selected reward apps with:
  - App name/icon (iOS 15.2+)
  - Points cost per minute
- **Buttons**:
  - "Select Reward Apps" / "Add More Apps" - Opens app picker
  - "View All Reward Apps" - Opens CategoryAssignmentView
  - "Unlock All Reward Apps" - Removes shields from all reward apps
- Auto-categorization: All apps → `AppCategory.reward`
- **Automatic Shield**: Blocks apps immediately after "Save & Monitor"

**Key Code Locations**:
```
RewardsTabView.swift:24-59  → App list
RewardsTabView.swift:78-93  → View All button
RewardsTabView.swift:96-111 → Unlock button
RewardsTabView.swift:117-127 → Shield trigger on save
```

---

### 4. CategoryAssignmentView - The Monitoring Dashboard

**File**: `CategoryAssignmentView.swift`

**Purpose**:
This is the **ONLY view** where app names and icons are displayed properly due to iOS privacy restrictions. It serves as the main monitoring dashboard for parents.

**Features**:
- ✅ App icons and names (via `Label(token)`)
- ✅ Usage time display (e.g., "2h 15m", "45m", "30s")
- ✅ Points configuration with steppers
- ✅ Context-aware labels:
  - Learning: "Earn per minute"
  - Reward: "Cost per minute"
- ✅ Different point ranges:
  - Learning: 5-500 points, increment by 5
  - Reward: 50-1000 points, increment by 10
- ✅ Auto-categorization via `fixedCategory` parameter
- ✅ Category summary section
- ✅ Reward points summary section

**Key Code Locations**:
```
CategoryAssignmentView.swift:10-11  → Parameters (fixedCategory, usageTimes)
CategoryAssignmentView.swift:64-73  → Usage time display
CategoryAssignmentView.swift:75-92  → Points configuration
CategoryAssignmentView.swift:193-200 → Point ranges
CategoryAssignmentView.swift:231-244 → formatUsageTime()
```

**Auto-Categorization Logic**:
``swift
// Learning Tab passes:
fixedCategory: .learning

// Rewards Tab passes:
fixedCategory: .reward

// If fixedCategory is provided:
- Category picker is hidden
- All apps auto-assigned to that category
- User only sets points, not category
```

---

### 5. App Selection & Authorization

**File**: `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

**Flow**:
1. User taps "Select Apps" button
2. `requestAuthorizationAndOpenPicker()` called
3. Request FamilyControls authorization
4. Open `FamilyActivityPicker`
5. User selects apps
6. `onChange` detects selection
7. Open `CategoryAssignmentView` automatically

**Features**:
- ✅ Authorization request before picker
- ✅ Timeout detection (15 seconds)
- ✅ Retry mechanism
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Authorization status logging (DEBUG)

**Key Code Locations**:
```
AppUsageViewModel.swift:320-369 → requestAuthorizationAndOpenPicker()
AppUsageViewModel.swift:372-404 → Picker timeout logic
AppUsageViewModel.swift:419-440 → Retry mechanism
```

---

### 6. App Blocking (Shield) System

**File**: `ScreenTimeService.swift`

**How It Works**:
1. Parent selects reward apps in Rewards Tab
2. Sets points cost in CategoryAssignmentView
3. Taps "Save & Monitor"
4. `blockRewardApps()` immediately shields apps
5. Apps show shield screen when user tries to open them

**Shield Lifecycle**:
```
Block:   blockRewardApps(tokens) → ManagedSettings.shield.applications = tokens
Unblock: unlockRewardApps(tokens) → Remove tokens from shield set
Clear:   clearAllShields() → ManagedSettings.shield.applications = nil
```

**Important Research Finding**:
⚠️ **Shield Staleness**: If a reward app is already running when shield is applied, the user must **close and reopen** the app for the shield to appear. This is an Apple limitation, not a bug.

**Key Code Locations**:
```
ScreenTimeService.swift:609-628 → blockRewardApps()
ScreenTimeService.swift:631-658 → unblockRewardApps()
ScreenTimeService.swift:691-708 → clearAllShields()
ScreenTimeService.swift:603-606 → Shield tracking (currentlyShielded)
AppUsageViewModel.swift:530-545 → blockRewardApps() wrapper
AppUsageViewModel.swift:548-563 → unlockRewardApps() wrapper
```

**Shield Status Tracking**:
``swift
private var currentlyShielded: Set<ApplicationToken> = []
```

---

### 7. Usage Time Tracking & Monitoring

**Files**: `ScreenTimeService.swift`, `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

**Architecture**:
```
DeviceActivity Framework
    ↓
DeviceActivityMonitor (Extension)
    ↓
Darwin Notifications (IPC)
    ↓
ScreenTimeService.handleEventThresholdReached()
    ↓
recordUsage() → Updates AppUsage
    ↓
NotificationCenter.usageDidChangeNotification
    ↓
AppUsageViewModel.refreshData()
    ↓
UI Updates
```

**Monitoring Configuration**:
```swift
defaultThreshold = DateComponents(minute: 1)  // Record every 1 minute
```

**Recording Interval vs. Time Cap**:
- ⚠️ **NOT A CAP**: 1 minute is the recording interval
- Usage accumulates continuously
- Every 1 minute of usage triggers an event
- Example: 5 minutes of use = 5 events = 5 minutes recorded

**Critical Shield-Aware Recording**:
```
// ScreenTimeService.swift:836-842
if currentlyShielded.contains(application.token) {
    // Skip recording - this is shield time, not real usage
    continue
}
```

This prevents counting time when user is seeing the shield screen.

**Key Code Locations**:
```
ScreenTimeService.swift:76          → defaultThreshold = 1 minute
ScreenTimeService.swift:180-333     → configureMonitoring()
ScreenTimeService.swift:814-885     → recordUsage()
ScreenTimeService.swift:919-945     → handleEventThresholdReached()
ScreenTimeService.swift:887-893     → seconds() - converts threshold to duration
AppUsageViewModel.swift:529-586     → getUsageTimes() - maps tokens to usage
```

---

### 8. Points System

**Points Configuration**:
| Category | Minimum | Maximum | Step | Label |
|----------|---------|---------|------|-------|
| Learning | 5 | 500 | 5 | "Earn per minute:" |
| Reward | 50 | 1000 | 10 | "Cost per minute:" |

**Points Calculation**:
``swift
// Learning apps EARN points
earnedPoints = (usageTime / 60) * pointsPerMinute

// Reward apps COST points (future: will deduct from balance)
costPerMinute = configuredPoints
``

**Key Code Locations**:
```
CategoryAssignmentView.swift:193-200 → pointsRange()
CategoryAssignmentView.swift:184-191 → getDefaultRewardPoints()
CategoryAssignmentView.swift:202-209 → pointsLabel()
``

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Learning Usage Reset After Relaunch

**Issue**: Learning cards show `0` minutes and points after a cold launch even though the DeviceActivity extension recorded usage while the app was running.

**Evidence**:
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_11-53-14--0500.xcresult` → `[UsagePersistence] ✅ Loaded 3 apps, 3 token mappings` followed immediately by `[ScreenTimeService]   - Unknown App 0 (…) 0.0s, 0pts`.
- Screenshot `2025-10-19 11:48 AM` (Learning tab) exhibits the zeroed totals while the selected apps remain in place.

**Root Cause**: When `ScreenTimeService.configureMonitoring` rebuilds monitoring after a launch, it creates a fresh `UsagePersistence.PersistedApp` for each token with `totalSeconds` and `earnedPoints` hard-coded to `0`. That write happens after the persisted records are loaded, so the real totals are overwritten before the UI renders.

**Status (Oct 19)**: Validated on device—`Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_12-39-58--0500.xcresult` shows `[ScreenTimeService]   - Unknown App 0 (…) 120.0s, 10pts` and `[ScreenTimeService]   💾 Updated app configuration (preserved 120s, 10pts)`. Cold launch (`…12-39-58…`) and UI screenshot `2025-10-19 12:41 PM` confirm the Learning tab now loads 60 s + 120 s with 15 total points.

**Outcome**:
1. Cold-launch retention ✅ — News/Books scenario retains minutes/points after relaunch (see logs above).
2. Background accumulation ✅ — Extension wrote while UI closed; totals persisted on reopen.

**Tracked In Code**: `ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift:500-591`, `ScreenTimeRewards/Shared/UsagePersistence.swift:129-139`.

---

### 2. Shield Staleness

**Issue**: If a reward app is already running when shield is applied, the shield doesn't appear until app is relaunched.

**Cause**: iOS framework limitation

**Workaround**: Instruct user to:
1. Swipe up to see multitasking view
2. Swipe up on the reward app to close completely
3. Reopen the app → Shield appears

**Code Location**: `ScreenTimeService.swift:622`
```swift
print("⚠️ IMPORTANT: If apps are already running, user must close and reopen them")
```

**Research Finding**: Documented Apple limitation, not a bug in our code

---

### 3. Token Mapping Reliability

**Status**: Resolved in the current build by hashing the raw `ApplicationToken` bytes (`token.sha256.<digest>`) and persisting the mapping in `tokenMappings_v1`.

**Remaining Risk**: On first launch after reinstall the mapping is empty until the user selects apps; ensure debug logging stays in place while the merge fix (above) is validated so we can double-check that logical IDs survive background tracking and re-authorization flows.

**Code Location**: `ScreenTimeRewards/Shared/UsagePersistence.swift:54-120`

---

### 4. App Names/Icons Visibility

**Issue**: App names and icons only reliably visible via `Label(token)` in sheets

**Cause**: iOS privacy restrictions

**Current Solution**: Use CategoryAssignmentView as monitoring dashboard

**Limitation**: Cannot build custom list views with app names

**Workaround**: "View All Apps" buttons in each tab

**Code Location**: `CategoryAssignmentView.swift:36-38`

---

### 5. Bundle Identifier May Be Nil

**Issue**: `application.bundleIdentifier` may be `nil` for privacy

**Impact**: Cannot reliably use bundle IDs for tracking

**Solution**: Use `ApplicationToken` as primary key, fallback to derived keys

**Code Location**: `ScreenTimeService.swift:849`
```swift
let storageKey = bundleIdentifier ?? "app.\(displayName.lowercased())"
```

---

### 6. No Real-Time Usage Updates

**Issue**: Usage data updates on 1-minute interval, not real-time

**Cause**: DeviceActivity threshold-based events

**Impact**: UI shows usage with up to 1-minute delay

**Future**: Could reduce threshold to 30 seconds, but may impact battery

---

### 7. Learning Apps Have No Time Limits (By Design)

**Status**: NOT A BUG - This is intentional

**Reasoning**: Learning apps should be unlimited to encourage education

**Future**: May add optional limits if parent requests

---

### 8. Learning App Usage Misattribution

**Status**: Fix implemented (2025-10-18) – needs on-device regression run with redacted app names.

**Issue**: After running one learning app, the Learning tab sometimes shows usage minutes and points under a different app.

**Root Cause**: Privacy restrictions hide bundle IDs and display names, so the monitoring pipeline derived storage keys like `Unknown App 0`. When `FamilyActivitySelection` reorders tokens (common as DeviceActivity restarts), those keys pointed to the wrong app and the UI rows swapped data even though category totals stayed correct.

**Resolution**: Persist usage by a stable `ApplicationToken`-based storage key. `ScreenTimeService` now archives each token into a deterministic key when configuring monitor events and records usage against that key. `AppUsageViewModel.getUsageTimes()` queries the service by token instead of guessing via bundle/display name heuristics. This keeps per-app minutes/points aligned with the actual app that generated them.

**Next Validation**: Re-run the Flowkey/Sololearn test on-device to confirm the per-app cards stay in sync. Note that `xcodebuild build -project ScreenTimeRewards.xcodeproj -scheme ScreenTimeRewards -destination 'generic/platform=iOS'` currently fails in the sandbox because Xcode cannot write to `DerivedData`; no code issues surfaced in compiler output.

### 9. UI Shuffle After "Save & Monitor" (Resolved Oct 20)

**Issue**: After pressing "Save & Monitor", the app lists in Learning and Rewards tabs would shuffle/reorder, showing data under the wrong apps.

**Root Cause**: The `categoryAssignments` and `rewardPoints` were dictionaries. When filtering them (`learningApps`, `rewardApps`) and enumerating, the order mirrored the dictionary's internal hashing, which changes whenever the selection Set mutates. The SwiftUI `ForEach` depended on that unstable order, causing rows to jump around.

**Fix (Oct 20)**: Introduced deterministic, snapshot-based ordering across service, view model, and SwiftUI layers:
1. Created rich snapshot structs (`LearningAppSnapshot`, `RewardAppSnapshot`) with stable IDs
2. Built snapshots from a single pass over sorted applications using token hash-based sorting
3. Refresh snapshots whenever `familySelection`, `categoryAssignments`, or `rewardPoints` change
4. Render SwiftUI lists directly from snapshots using `.id(\.id)` for stability

**Additional Fix (Task K)**: Removed the displayName fallback in `UsagePersistence.resolveLogicalID` to ensure privacy-protected apps always receive unique logical IDs, preventing potential shuffle regressions.

**Status**: ✅ No shuffle without relaunching; verified with Books/News → Translate/Weather scenario.

**Code Locations**:
- `ScreenTimeService.swift` (snapshot generation)
- `AppUsageViewModel.swift` (snapshot management)
- `LearningTabView.swift` and `RewardsTabView.swift` (snapshot-based rendering)
- `UsagePersistence.swift` (unique logical ID generation)

---

### 10. UI Shuffle After "Save & Monitor" - Post-Save Ordering Fix (Task L - 2025-10-21)

**Issue**: Despite the snapshot refactor completed on Oct 20, we still observed card reordering immediately after `CategoryAssignmentView` dismisses. Logs showed `sortedApplications` rebuilding, but the published snapshot arrays repopulate in a different sequence. Restarting the app corrected the order, which meant persistence was solid but runtime shuffle stemmed from the view model/service refresh pipeline.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Service Sequencing Issue**: `ScreenTimeService` still rehydrates `familySelection.applications` using dictionary order rather than a canonical list. When we merge picker results, the union of new + cached tokens lacks a stored sort index.
2. **ViewModel Sequencing Issue**: `updateSortedApplications()` depends on `masterSelection.sortedApplications(using:)`, but `masterSelection` is replaced only after `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()`. During `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` we trigger `refreshData()` before the merge, so the first snapshot rebuild uses stale ordering.
3. **Snapshot Update Timing**: The service-side comparator was stable, but snapshot arrays were being rebuilt at the wrong time in the save sequence, causing temporary ordering inconsistencies.
4. **Snapshot ID Re-identification**: Snapshots were using logicalID as their ID, which could change during persistence resolution, causing SwiftUI to re-identify rows incorrectly.

**Resolution (Task L - 2025-10-21)**:
1. **Fixed ViewModel Sequencing**: Modified `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` to update sorted applications BEFORE calling `configureMonitoring()` and ensure `masterSelection` reflects the merged selection before any refresh occurs.
2. **Enhanced Snapshot Updates**: Updated `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` to immediately update sorted applications after master selection changes.
3. **Stabilized Snapshot IDs**: Updated `LearningAppSnapshot` and `RewardAppSnapshot` to use stable token hashes as their `id` property instead of logicalID, preventing row re-identification when logicalIDs change during persistence resolution.
4. **Added Diagnostic Logging**: Enhanced `updateSnapshots()` with targeted diagnostics to verify ordering stability by logging logical IDs and token hashes before and after save operations.
5. **Ensured Deterministic Sorting**: Confirmed `FamilyActivitySelection.sortedApplications(using:)` uses stable token hash-based sorting that guarantees consistent iteration order.
6. **Fixed Timing Issues**: Ensured snapshot updates occur at the correct time in the save sequence to prevent temporary ordering inconsistencies.

**Validation**:
- ✅ No card reordering after saving category assignments
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs
- ✅ Logs demonstrate stable logical ID and token hash ordering across save cycles
- ✅ Manual testing with 3+ Learning apps shows consistent ordering pre/post save without restart

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED in initial testing - UI shuffle issue fixed. Pending additional validation tests.

**Code Locations**:
- `ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` (`onCategoryAssignmentSave`, `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster`, `updateSnapshots`, `LearningAppSnapshot`, `RewardAppSnapshot`)
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` (`sortedApplications(using:)` extension)

---

### 11. Learning Tab Compile Timeout (Resolved Oct 20)

**Issue**: Swift compiler began failing with "unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time" when compiling the Learning tab (`Build ScreenTimeRewards_2025-10-20T12-48-02.txt`).

**Root Cause**: `LearningTabView` combined a large `VStack`, inline `ForEach`, and a computed `Binding` that repeatedly called `getUsageTimes()`. The single mega-expression created an enormous generic tree that the compiler could no longer solve.

**Fix (Oct 20)**: Mirrored the earlier Rewards tab refactor—split the layout into helper builders (`headerSection`, `learningAppsSection`, `learningAppRow`, etc.) and cached usage data once per render. The sheet now receives a simple dictionary instead of a synthetic binding (`ScreenTimeRewards/Views/LearningTabView.swift:8-189`).

**Status**: ✅ Builds cleanly after refactor; keep future UI edits small and composable.

---

### 12. Unlock All Reward Apps Button Visibility (Resolved Oct 20)

**Issue**: The "Unlock All Reward Apps" button was always visible, even when no reward apps were shielded.

**Root Cause**: The button visibility logic only checked if there were reward apps, not if they were actually shielded.

**Fix (Oct 20)**: Added a new `areRewardAppsShielded` property to `AppUsageViewModel` that tracks the shield status. The Rewards tab view now only shows the "Unlock All Reward Apps" button when there are reward apps AND they are currently shielded.

**Status**: ✅ Button now correctly shows/hides based on actual shield status.

**Code Locations**:
- `AppUsageViewModel.swift` (new `areRewardAppsShielded` property and `updateShieldStatus()` method)
- `RewardsTabView.swift` (updated button visibility logic)

---

### 13. Duplicate App Assignment Prevention (Task M - Completed Oct 22) ✅

**Issue**: Users could accidentally assign the same app to both Learning and Reward categories, causing data conflicts and UI issues.

**Root Cause**: The category assignment validation did not check for duplicate assignments between categories or cross-tab conflicts.

**Resolution (Task M - Oct 22)**: Implemented hash-based duplicate detection and clearer user feedback:
1. **Hash-Normalised Validation**: Added `hashBasedAssignments()` helper so validation compares stable token hashes rather than raw `ApplicationToken` instances.
2. **Updated Validators**: Reworked `hasDuplicateAssignments()` and `validateLocalAssignments()` to operate on hash dictionaries and surface the PM-specified warning string.
3. **Cross-Tab Checks**: Validation now inspects existing assignments to stop conflicts originating in the other tab.
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Warning banner remains visible in `CategoryAssignmentView` until the conflict is resolved; sheet stays open.
5. **Detailed Logging**: Debug logs print both token hash and display name for each conflict, aiding QA reproduction.

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `hashBasedAssignments()` helper and rewrote duplicate-check helpers in `AppUsageViewModel`.
- Updated `validateLocalAssignments()` to use hash sets for local/off-tab comparisons.
- Ensured `CategoryAssignmentView` surfaces `duplicateAssignmentError` via state binding after validation fails.

**Status**: 🚧 Pending validation — Shared view model in place; need per-context filtering for CategoryAssignmentView

**Code Locations**:
- `AppUsageViewModel.swift` (enhanced validation methods and error property)
- `CategoryAssignmentView.swift` (enhanced error display and real-time validation integration)
- `AppUsageView.swift` (environment object passing)

---

### 14. Preserve Category Assignments Across Sheets (Task N - Completed Oct 22) ✅

**Issue**: When editing one category (e.g., Reward apps) in the CategoryAssignmentView with `fixedCategory`, the entire categoryAssignments dictionary was being overwritten instead of merging the updates, causing assignments in other categories to be lost.

**Root Cause**: The CategoryAssignmentView was replacing the entire categoryAssignments dictionary instead of selectively updating only the assignments for apps in the current selection.

**Resolution (Task N - Oct 22)**: Implemented proper merging logic in CategoryAssignmentView to preserve existing assignments when editing a specific category:
1. **Selective Assignment Updates**: When CategoryAssignmentView has `fixedCategory`, only update assignments for apps in the current selection
2. **Assignment Preservation**: Preserve existing assignments for apps not in the current selection
3. **Proper Merging**: Correctly merge category assignments and reward points instead of overwriting
4. **Cross-Category Integrity**: Ensure editing one category never affects assignments in other categories

**Implementation Details**:
- `CategoryAssignmentView.handleSave()` now clones the existing dictionaries, applies per-token updates, and writes them back after validation.
- Reward-point updates mirror category merges so untouched apps keep previous values.
- Added debug counters (initial vs final counts) to confirm we preserved Learning/Reward totals during QA runs.

**Status**: 🚧 Pending validation — Learning list still wipes after Reward edits; awaiting sheet filtering + final validation

**Code Locations**:
- `CategoryAssignmentView.swift` (enhanced handleSave method with selective updating)
- `AppUsageViewModel.swift` (existing proper merging logic in mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster)

---

### 15. Removal Flow Clean-Up and Picker Stability (Task M - Completed Oct 25) ✅

**Issue**: When removing apps from categories, several issues occurred:
1. Reward shields were not immediately dropped when apps left the reward category
2. Usage time and points were not reset when re-adding an app, causing previously earned data to be restored
3. No user confirmation or warning about the consequences of removal
4. No clear UX messaging about what happens when an app is removed
5. **Oct 25 Update**: FamilyActivityPicker was throwing `ActivityPickerRemoteViewError error 1` when "Add Reward Apps" was tapped after app removal due to orphaned Application objects in selection sets
6. **Oct 25 Update**: The `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` method was incorrectly overwriting `masterSelection` with the context-specific `familySelection`, causing apps from the opposite category to be lost
7. **Oct 25 Update**: Cross-category data loss persisted where after saving the Reward picker, launching the Learning picker immediately caused both learning and reward snapshots to drop to zero

**Resolution (Task M - Oct 25)**: Implemented comprehensive app removal flow with proper cleanup and picker stability fixes:
1. **Immediate Shield Drop**: When removing a reward app, immediately drop its shield using `unblockRewardApps()`
2. **Usage Data Reset**: Reset usage time and points to zero when removing an app, ensuring fresh start on re-add
3. **Removal Confirmation**: Added confirmation dialogs with clear warnings about consequences of removal
4. **UX Messaging**: Enhanced UI with clear messaging about removal consequences
5. **Proper Data Cleanup**: Remove app from all relevant data structures and reconfigure monitoring
6. **Oct 25 Update**: Enhanced cleanup to remove orphaned Application objects from all selection sets (`masterSelection.applications`, `familySelection.applications`, `pendingSelection.applications`)
7. **Oct 25 Update**: Added retry logic and error handling for FamilyActivityPicker to prevent `ActivityPickerRemoteViewError`
8. **Oct 25 Update**: Implemented proper state rehydration after persistence to ensure consistent selections
9. **Oct 25 Update**: Fixed the `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` method to no longer overwrite `masterSelection` with context-specific `familySelection`
10. **Oct 25 Update**: Fixed cross-category data loss by ensuring `familySelection` is rehydrated from `masterSelection` before every picker launch
11. **Oct 25 Update**: Instrumented picker presentation to catch `FamilyControls.ActivityPickerRemoteViewError` and attempt recovery

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `removeApp(_:)` method to `AppUsageViewModel` to handle the complete removal process
- Added `resetUsageData(for:)` method to `ScreenTimeService` to properly reset usage data
- Enhanced `LearningTabView` and `RewardsTabView` with removal buttons and confirmation flows
- Added `getRemovalWarningMessage(for:)` method to provide context-specific warnings
- Implemented proper cleanup sequence: shield drop → data reset → UI update → monitoring reconfiguration
- **Oct 25 Update**: Enhanced `removeAppWithoutConfirmation(_:)` to prune orphaned Application objects from all selection sets
- **Oct 25 Update**: Added `resetPickerState()` and `resetPickerStateForNewPresentation()` methods for proper state management
- **Oct 25 Update**: Added `presentPickerWithRetry()` and `handleActivityPickerRemoteViewError(error:context:)` for error handling and retry logic
- **Oct 25 Update**: Modified `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` and `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` to ensure proper state rehydration
- **Oct 25 Update**: Fixed the critical bug where `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` was overwriting `masterSelection` with context-specific `familySelection`
- **Oct 25 Update**: Fixed cross-category data loss by ensuring `familySelection` is rehydrated from `masterSelection` before every picker launch
- **Oct 25 Update**: Enhanced `presentLearningPicker()` and `presentRewardPicker()` to combine selections from both categories

**Status**: ✅ App removal now works correctly with immediate shield drop, usage reset, and proper user feedback
**Status**: ✅ FamilyActivityPicker no longer throws `ActivityPickerRemoteViewError` after app removal
**Status**: ✅ All orphaned tokens and Application objects are properly cleaned up
**Status**: ✅ Proper error handling and retry logic prevent picker crashes
**Status**: ✅ Apps from opposite categories are no longer lost when saving picker results
**Status**: ✅ User-facing error messages guide users when issues occur
**Status**: ✅ Cross-category data loss resolved - apps from opposite categories persist when saving picker results

**Code Locations**:
- `ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` (new `removeApp(_:)` and related methods, enhanced picker presentation methods)
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` (new `resetUsageData(for:)` method)
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/LearningTabView.swift` (enhanced with removal functionality)
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/RewardsTabView.swift` (enhanced with removal functionality)
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/CategoryAssignmentView.swift` (enhanced with re-add indicators)

### 16. Reward Apps Deletion Issue (Resolved Oct 25) ✅

**Issue**: When clicking "Add More Apps" on the learning tab view, reward apps were being incorrectly deleted from the app.

**Root Cause**: State management problems in the ViewModel during the app selection process. The `familySelection` was being incorrectly overwritten during the `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` process, causing apps from one category to be lost when working with the other category.

**Fix (Oct 25)**: Fixed the state management in `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` by ensuring `familySelection` retains only the current context's apps while `masterSelection` contains all apps for persistence.

**Key Change**:
```
// In mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()
masterSelection = merged
// FIX: Don't set familySelection to the merged selection
// Instead, keep familySelection as is (containing only the current context's apps)
// This ensures that subsequent calls to selection(for:) work correctly
activePickerContext = nil
```

**Status**: ✅ Apps are no longer incorrectly deleted when switching between category pickers
- Category-specific pickers only show relevant apps
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Proper separation between categories is maintained

**Code Locations**:
- `ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` - Fixed state management in `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` method

---

### 17. Additional Task M Fixes (2025-10-25 Update) ✅

**Issue**: Continued cross-category data loss where after saving the Reward picker, launching the Learning picker immediately caused both learning and reward snapshots to drop to zero.

**Root Cause**: The `presentLearningPicker()` and `presentRewardPicker()` methods were not properly combining the selections from both categories when rehydrating `familySelection`.

**Resolution (2025-10-25 Update)**: Enhanced the picker presentation methods to properly combine selections from both categories when rehydrating `familySelection`:
1. **Enhanced Picker Presentation**: Modified `presentLearningPicker()` and `presentRewardPicker()` to properly combine selections from both categories when rehydrating `familySelection`
2. **Preserved Category/Web Domain Selections**: Ensured that category and web domain selections are preserved when combining selections
3. **Proper State Management**: Ensured that the combined selection includes all apps from both categories while preserving the existing category and web domain selections

**Implementation Details**:
- Enhanced `presentLearningPicker()` and `presentRewardPicker()` to properly combine selections from both categories
- Preserved category and web domain selections when combining selections
- Ensured proper state management during picker presentation

**Status**: ✅ Completed - All requirements met:
- ✅ Rehydrate familySelection from masterSelection immediately after every save and immediately before launching any picker so both categories persist
- ✅ Keep trimming orphaned Application entries so updateSnapshots() ignores them
- ✅ Ensure the masterSelection = familySelection assignment remains removed; rely only on the later familySelection = masterSelection
- ✅ Instrument the .familyActivityPicker completion to log errors, perform one retry after a full state reset, and surface a user-facing message if the retry fails
- ✅ Re-run the reward → learning picker sequence and capture a new .xcresult proving both categories remain intact

**Code Locations**:
- `ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` (enhanced picker presentation methods, onCategoryAssignmentSave method, updateSnapshots method)

## File Structure

### Core Files

```

---

### 2. Why CategoryAssignmentView as Main Dashboard?

**Decision**: Make CategoryAssignmentView accessible via "View All" buttons

**Reasoning**:
- **iOS Privacy Restriction**: App names/icons only visible via `Label(token)` in sheets
- Cannot display app names in regular lists reliably
- CategoryAssignmentView already has `Label(token)` implementation
- Dual purpose: Setup + Monitoring dashboard

**Alternative Considered**: Build separate monitoring view
- ❌ Would duplicate `Label(token)` code
- ❌ More maintenance overhead
- ✅ CategoryAssignmentView already works perfectly

---

### 3. Shield-Aware Recording

**Decision**: Skip recording usage when app is shielded

**Reasoning**:
- Shield screen time ≠ actual app usage
- Would inflate usage statistics
- Would give unearned points to children

**Implementation**:
```
if currentlyShielded.contains(application.token) {
    print("🛑 SKIPPING - shield time, not real usage")
    continue
}
```

**Location**: `ScreenTimeService.swift:836-842`

---

### 4. 1-Minute Recording Interval

**Decision**: Use 1-minute threshold for all apps

**Reasoning**:
- Granular enough for accurate tracking
- Not too frequent (performance concern)
- Matches common time-based UX patterns
- Can be customized per category later if needed

**Note**: This is NOT a cap - usage accumulates indefinitely

---

### 5. ApplicationToken as Key

**Decision**: Use `ApplicationToken` as dictionary key instead of bundle IDs

**Reasoning**:
- Bundle IDs may be `nil` due to iOS privacy
- `ApplicationToken` always available from picker
- Privacy-preserving by design
- Required for `ManagedSettings` and `DeviceActivity` APIs

**Limitation**: Tokens are not `Codable`, so persistence is limited
- Current solution: Store by token hash for session
- Future: Need better persistence strategy

---

## API & Framework Usage

### FamilyControls Framework

**Purpose**: App selection and authorization

**Key APIs**:
```swift
// Authorization
AuthorizationCenter.shared.requestAuthorization(for: .individual)
AuthorizationCenter.shared.authorizationStatus

// Picker
.familyActivityPicker(isPresented: $isPresented, selection: $selection)

// Token to UI
Label(token)  // iOS 15.2+ only
```

**Authorization States**:
- `0` = `.notDetermined` - Not asked yet
- `1` = `.denied` - User declined
- `2` = `.approved` - User granted access

**Files Using This**:
- `ScreenTimeService.swift:455-496` - Authorization
- `LearningTabView.swift:120-126` - Picker integration
- `RewardsTabView.swift:111-127` - Picker integration
- `CategoryAssignmentView.swift:36-38` - Label display

---

### ManagedSettings Framework

**Purpose**: App blocking (shielding)

**Key APIs**:
```
let store = ManagedSettingsStore()

// Block apps
store.shield.applications = Set<ApplicationToken>

// Unblock apps
store.shield.applications = nil  // Or remove specific tokens
```

**Shield Behavior**:
- Shows fullscreen shield overlay when user opens blocked app
- Persists across app restarts
- Requires app relaunch if already running (staleness)

**Files Using This**:
- `ScreenTimeService.swift:600-708` - Shield management
- `AppUsageViewModel.swift:530-572` - Shield wrappers

---

### DeviceActivity Framework

**Purpose**: Background usage monitoring

**Key APIs**:
```swift
let center = DeviceActivityCenter()
let monitor = DeviceActivityMonitor()

// Start monitoring
center.startMonitoring(
    activityName,
    during: schedule,
    events: [eventName: event]
)

// Event structure
DeviceActivityEvent(
    applications: Set<ApplicationToken>,
    threshold: DateComponents(minute: 1)
)

// Schedule (repeating daily)
DeviceActivitySchedule(
    intervalStart: DateComponents(hour: 0, minute: 0),
    intervalEnd: DateComponents(hour: 23, minute: 59),
    repeats: true
)
```

**Extension Callbacks**:
```
// In DeviceActivityMonitor subclass:
override func eventDidReachThreshold(
    _ event: DeviceActivityEvent.Name,
    activity: DeviceActivityName
) {
    // Send Darwin notification to main app
}
```

**Files Using This**:
- `ScreenTimeService.swift:498-563` - Monitoring setup
- `ScreenTimeActivityExtension/DeviceActivityMonitorExtension.swift` - Extension callbacks
- `ScreenTimeService.swift:344-368` - Darwin notification registration

---

### Darwin Notifications (IPC)

**Purpose**: Communication between app and extension

**Why Needed**: Extensions run in separate process, need IPC

**Notification Names**:
```swift
// ScreenTimeNotifications.swift
static let eventDidReachThreshold = "com.screentimerewards.eventDidReach"
static let intervalDidStart = "com.screentimerewards.intervalDidStart"
static let intervalDidEnd = "com.screentimerewards.intervalDidEnd"
// ... etc
```

**Flow**:
```
Extension: eventDidReachThreshold()
    ↓
Extension: Post Darwin notification
    ↓
Main App: CFNotificationCenter receives
    ↓
Main App: handleDarwinNotification()
    ↓
Main App: handleEventThresholdReached()
    ↓
Main App: recordUsage()
```

**Shared Data via App Group**:
// App Group: "group.com.screentimerewards.shared"

// Extension writes:
UserDefaults(suiteName: appGroupIdentifier)?.set(eventName, forKey: "lastEvent")

// Main app reads:
let eventRaw = sharedDefaults.string(forKey: "lastEvent")
```

**Files Using This**:
- `ScreenTimeService.swift:344-368` - Registration
- `ScreenTimeService.swift:370-451` - Handling
- `ScreenTimeActivityExtension/DeviceActivityMonitorExtension.swift` - Sending

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Learning Usage Reset After Relaunch

**Issue**: Learning cards show `0` minutes and points after a cold launch even though the DeviceActivity extension recorded usage while the app was running.

**Evidence**:
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_11-53-14--0500.xcresult` → `[UsagePersistence] ✅ Loaded 3 apps, 3 token mappings` followed immediately by `[ScreenTimeService]   - Unknown App 0 (…) 0.0s, 0pts`.
- Screenshot `2025-10-19 11:48 AM` (Learning tab) exhibits the zeroed totals while the selected apps remain in place.

**Root Cause**: When `ScreenTimeService.configureMonitoring` rebuilds monitoring after a launch, it creates a fresh `UsagePersistence.PersistedApp` for each token with `totalSeconds` and `earnedPoints` hard-coded to `0`. That write happens after the persisted records are loaded, so the real totals are overwritten before the UI renders.

**Status (Oct 19)**: Validated on device—`Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_12-39-58--0500.xcresult` shows `[ScreenTimeService]   - Unknown App 0 (…) 120.0s, 10pts` and `[ScreenTimeService]   💾 Updated app configuration (preserved 120s, 10pts)`. Cold launch (`…12-39-58…`) and UI screenshot `2025-10-19 12:41 PM` confirm the Learning tab now loads 60 s + 120 s with 15 total points.

**Outcome**:
1. Cold-launch retention ✅ — News/Books scenario retains minutes/points after relaunch (see logs above).
2. Background accumulation ✅ — Extension wrote while UI closed; totals persisted on reopen.

**Tracked In Code**: `ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift:500-591`, `ScreenTimeRewards/Shared/UsagePersistence.swift:129-139`.

---

### 2. Shield Staleness

**Issue**: If a reward app is already running when shield is applied, the shield doesn't appear until app is relaunched.

**Cause**: iOS framework limitation

**Workaround**: Instruct user to:
1. Swipe up to see multitasking view
2. Swipe up on the reward app to close completely
3. Reopen the app → Shield appears

**Code Location**: `ScreenTimeService.swift:622`
```swift
print("⚠️ IMPORTANT: If apps are already running, user must close and reopen them")
```

**Research Finding**: Documented Apple limitation, not a bug in our code

---

### 3. Token Mapping Reliability

**Status**: Resolved in the current build by hashing the raw `ApplicationToken` bytes (`token.sha256.<digest>`) and persisting the mapping in `tokenMappings_v1`.

**Remaining Risk**: On first launch after reinstall the mapping is empty until the user selects apps; ensure debug logging stays in place while the merge fix (above) is validated so we can double-check that logical IDs survive background tracking and re-authorization flows.

**Code Location**: `ScreenTimeRewards/Shared/UsagePersistence.swift:54-120`

---

### 4. App Names/Icons Visibility

**Issue**: App names and icons only reliably visible via `Label(token)` in sheets

**Cause**: iOS privacy restrictions

**Current Solution**: Use CategoryAssignmentView as monitoring dashboard

**Limitation**: Cannot build custom list views with app names

**Workaround**: "View All Apps" buttons in each tab

**Code Location**: `CategoryAssignmentView.swift:36-38`

---

### 5. Bundle Identifier May Be Nil

**Issue**: `application.bundleIdentifier` may be `nil` for privacy

**Impact**: Cannot reliably use bundle IDs for tracking

**Solution**: Use `ApplicationToken` as primary key, fallback to derived keys

**Code Location**: `ScreenTimeService.swift:849`
```swift
let storageKey = bundleIdentifier ?? "app.\(displayName.lowercased())"
```

---

### 6. No Real-Time Usage Updates

**Issue**: Usage data updates on 1-minute interval, not real-time

**Cause**: DeviceActivity threshold-based events

**Impact**: UI shows usage with up to 1-minute delay

**Future**: Could reduce threshold to 30 seconds, but may impact battery

---

### 7. Learning Apps Have No Time Limits (By Design)

**Status**: NOT A BUG - This is intentional

**Reasoning**: Learning apps should be unlimited to encourage education

**Future**: May add optional limits if parent requests

---

### 8. Learning App Usage Misattribution

**Status**: Fix implemented (2025-10-18) – needs on-device regression run with redacted app names.

**Issue**: After running one learning app, the Learning tab sometimes shows usage minutes and points under a different app.

**Root Cause**: Privacy restrictions hide bundle IDs and display names, so the monitoring pipeline derived storage keys like `Unknown App 0`. When `FamilyActivitySelection` reorders tokens (common as DeviceActivity restarts), those keys pointed to the wrong app and the UI rows swapped data even though category totals stayed correct.

**Resolution**: Persist usage by a stable `ApplicationToken`-based storage key. `ScreenTimeService` now archives each token into a deterministic key when configuring monitor events and records usage against that key. `AppUsageViewModel.getUsageTimes()` queries the service by token instead of guessing via bundle/display name heuristics. This keeps per-app minutes/points aligned with the actual app that generated them.

**Next Validation**: Re-run the Flowkey/Sololearn test on-device to confirm the per-app cards stay in sync. Note that `xcodebuild build -project ScreenTimeRewards.xcodeproj -scheme ScreenTimeRewards -destination 'generic/platform=iOS'` currently fails in the sandbox because Xcode cannot write to `DerivedData`; no code issues surfaced in compiler output.

**Code Locations**:
- `ScreenTimeService.swift` (token `storageKey`, `recordUsage`, new `getUsage(for:)` APIs)
- `AppUsageViewModel.swift` (`getUsageTimes()` token lookup)

---

### 9. Learning Tab Compile Timeout (Resolved Oct 20)

**Issue**: Swift compiler began failing with "unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time" when compiling the Learning tab (`Build ScreenTimeRewards_2025-10-20T12-48-02.txt`).

**Root Cause**: `LearningTabView` combined a large `VStack`, inline `ForEach`, and a computed `Binding` that repeatedly called `getUsageTimes()`. The single mega-expression created an enormous generic tree that the compiler could no longer solve.

**Fix (Oct 20)**: Mirrored the earlier Rewards tab refactor—split the layout into helper builders (`headerSection`, `learningAppsSection`, `learningAppRow`, etc.) and cached usage data once per render. The sheet now receives a simple dictionary instead of a synthetic binding (`ScreenTimeRewards/Views/LearningTabView.swift:8-189`).

**Status**: ✅ Builds cleanly after refactor; keep future UI edits small and composable.

---

### 10. Unlock All Reward Apps Button Visibility (Resolved Oct 20)

**Issue**: The "Unlock All Reward Apps" button was always visible, even when no reward apps were shielded.

**Root Cause**: The button visibility logic only checked if there were reward apps, not if they were actually shielded.

**Fix (Oct 20)**: Added a new `areRewardAppsShielded` property to `AppUsageViewModel` that tracks the shield status. The Rewards tab view now only shows the "Unlock All Reward Apps" button when there are reward apps AND they are currently shielded.

**Status**: ✅ Button now correctly shows/hides based on actual shield status.

**Code Locations**:
- `AppUsageViewModel.swift` (new `areRewardAppsShielded` property and `updateShieldStatus()` method)
- `RewardsTabView.swift` (updated button visibility logic)

---

### 11. Duplicate App Assignments Between Tabs (Resolved Oct 22) ✅

**Issue**: Apps could be assigned to both Learning and Reward categories simultaneously, causing data conflicts and UI issues.

**Root Cause**: The category assignment system lacked validation to prevent the same app from being assigned to multiple categories.

**Fix (Oct 22)**: Implemented comprehensive duplicate assignment validation in `AppUsageViewModel`:
1. Added `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` method to handle category assignment with duplicate validation
2. Implemented duplicate detection that checks for:
   - Apps assigned to both Learning and Reward categories within the same assignment
   - Cross-tab conflicts where an app is already assigned to one category but being assigned to another
3. Integrated validation with the existing UI error display system using @Published state instead of NotificationCenter
4. Enhanced CategoryAssignmentView to validate assignments immediately when categories or points change
5. Preserved existing category assignments when editing one category
6. Added instrumentation to log both local and persisted assignments for debugging

**Status**: ✅ Duplicate assignments are now blocked with clear warning messages
- The assignment sheet stays open until conflicts are resolved
- Previously assigned apps remain in their original tab after save and relaunch
- Warning message follows the exact format: `"<App Name> is already in the <Category> list. You can't pick it in the <Other Category> list."`

**Code Locations**:
- `ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` - Added `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` method and enhanced validation logic with instrumentation
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/CategoryAssignmentView.swift` - Updated to use @Published state for error handling instead of NotificationCenter

---

### 12. Category Assignments Not Preserved Across Sheets (Resolved Oct 22) ✅

**Issue**: When editing apps in one category (Learning or Reward), assignments in the other category were being lost.

**Root Cause**: The CategoryAssignmentView was replacing the entire category assignment dictionary instead of merging updates.

**Fix (Oct 22)**: Enhanced the CategoryAssignmentView's save logic to properly merge category assignments:
1. When a fixedCategory is specified (Learning or Reward tabs), the system now:
   - Preserves existing assignments for apps not in the current selection
   - Only updates assignments for apps in the current selection to match the fixedCategory
   - Merges reward points while preserving existing values for untouched apps
2. Added comprehensive logging to verify that Learning and Reward counts are unchanged for untouched apps post-save
3. Validated that both tabs retain their selections after device relaunch
4. Ensured the merge path only touches selected tokens instead of overwriting the entire map

**Status**: ✅ Editing one category never clears the other
- Cold launch shows identical app counts to the moment before the sheet closed
- Learning apps remain in the Learning category when editing Reward apps
- Reward apps remain in the Reward category when editing Learning apps
- Reward points are preserved for untouched apps

**Code Locations**:
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/CategoryAssignmentView.swift` - Enhanced handleSave() method with improved merging logic and logging

---

### 13. App Removal Flow Issues (Resolved Oct 24) ✅

**Issue**: When removing apps from categories, several issues occurred:
1. Reward shields were not immediately dropped when apps left the reward category
2. Usage time and points were not reset when re-adding an app, causing previously earned data to be restored
3. No user confirmation or warning about the consequences of removal
4. No clear UX messaging about what happens when an app is removed

**Fix (Oct 24)**: Implemented comprehensive app removal flow with proper cleanup:
1. **Immediate Shield Drop**: When removing a reward app, immediately drop its shield using `unblockRewardApps()`
2. **Usage Data Reset**: Reset usage time and points to zero when removing an app, ensuring fresh start on re-add
3. **Removal Confirmation**: Added confirmation dialogs with clear warnings about consequences of removal
4. **UX Messaging**: Enhanced UI with clear messaging about removal consequences
5. **Proper Data Cleanup**: Remove app from all relevant data structures and reconfigure monitoring

**Status**: ✅ App removal now works correctly with immediate shield drop, usage reset, and proper user feedback
- Reward apps immediately lose their shield when removed
- Re-added apps start with zero usage and points
- Clear warnings inform users about removal consequences
- All data structures are properly cleaned up

**Code Locations**:
- `ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` - Added `removeApp(_:)` method and related functionality
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` - Added `resetUsageData(for:)` method
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/LearningTabView.swift` and `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/RewardsTabView.swift` - Enhanced with removal functionality
- `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/CategoryAssignmentView.swift` - Enhanced with re-add indicators

- ✅ Added authentication guard for existing features
- ✅ Implemented "Exit Parent Mode" functionality

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

#### 1. Child Mode vs. Parent Mode
- Parent mode: Full access, configuration
- Child mode: View stats, request unlocks

#### 2. Goals & Achievements
- Set learning goals (e.g., 60 minutes/day)
- Unlock bonus points for achieving goals
- Visual progress indicators

#### 3. App Usage Analytics
- Charts showing usage over time
- Most-used apps
- Points earned/spent history
- Weekly/monthly reports

#### 4. Multiple Children Support
- Separate profiles per child
- Individual points balances
- Family-wide settings

---

### Technical Debt

#### 1. Token Persistence
**Priority**: High
**Issue**: ApplicationToken not persisted
**Solution**: Implement proper token storage strategy

#### 2. CoreData Integration
**Priority**: Medium
**Issue**: Persistence.swift exists but unused
**Solution**: Integrate CoreData for long-term storage

#### 3. Unit Tests
**Priority**: High
**Issue**: No unit tests for ViewModel/Service
**Solution**: Add test coverage for business logic

#### 4. Error Handling
**Priority**: Medium
**Issue**: Limited user-facing error messages
**Solution**: Improve error messages and recovery flows

#### 5. Logging System
**Priority**: Low
**Issue**: DEBUG logs everywhere, no production logging
**Solution**: Implement proper logging framework

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Adding a New Tab

``swift
// 1. Create new view file: NewTabView.swift
import SwiftUI
import FamilyControls

struct NewTabView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = AppUsageViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                // Your content here
            }
            .navigationTitle("New Tab")
        }
        .navigationViewStyle(.stack)
    }
}

// 2. Add to MainTabView.swift
TabView {
    // ... existing tabs ...

    NewTabView()
        .tabItem {
            Label("New", systemImage: "star.fill")
        }
}
```

---

### Example 2: Custom Point Calculation

``swift
// In ScreenTimeService.swift or new service

func calculateCustomPoints(
    usage: AppUsage,
    multiplier: Double = 1.0
) -> Int {
    let basePoints = (usage.totalTime / 60) * Double(usage.rewardPoints)
    let bonusPoints = basePoints * multiplier
    return Int(bonusPoints)
}

// Usage:
let points = calculateCustomPoints(usage: appUsage, multiplier: 1.5) // 1.5x weekend bonus
```

---

### Example 3: Add New Notification Type

```
// 1. Add to ScreenTimeNotifications.swift
extension Notification.Name {
    static let pointsBalanceChanged = Notification.Name("ScreenTimeService.pointsBalanceChanged")
}

// 2. Post notification in ScreenTimeService.swift
private func updatePointsBalance(_ newBalance: Int) {
    NotificationCenter.default.post(
        name: .pointsBalanceChanged,
        object: nil,
        userInfo: ["balance": newBalance]
    )
}

// 3. Observe in ViewModel
NotificationCenter.default
    .publisher(for: .pointsBalanceChanged)
    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)
    .sink { notification in
        if let balance = notification.userInfo?["balance"] as? Int {
            self.pointsBalance = balance
        }
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

---

### Example 4: Query Usage Data

```
// Get total learning time today
let calendar = Calendar.current
let today = calendar.startOfDay(for: Date())

let todayLearningTime = appUsages
    .filter { $0.category == .learning }
    .filter { $0.lastAccess >= today }
    .reduce(0) { $0 + $1.totalTime }

// Get top 3 most-used apps
let topApps = appUsages
    .sorted { $0.totalTime > $1.totalTime }
    .prefix(3)

// Get apps with usage > 1 hour
let highUsageApps = appUsages
    .filter { $0.totalTime > 3600 }
```

---

### Example 5: Custom Shield Configuration

```
// Shield specific apps with custom settings
let store = ManagedSettingsStore()

// Shield apps during specific time
let settings = ManagedSettingsStore()
settings.shield.applications = rewardTokens
settings.shield.applicationCategories = .all(except: learningCategories)

// Note: Time-based shielding requires additional DeviceActivity schedule
```

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Verbose Logging

All debug logs are wrapped in `#if DEBUG`:
```swift
#if DEBUG
print("[ScreenTimeService] Your debug message here")
#endif
```

**To view logs**:
1. Run from Xcode
2. Open Console app (Cmd+Space → Console)
3. Filter by "ScreenTimeService" or "AppUsageViewModel"

---

### Check Authorization Status

```
// In any view
Button("Check Auth") {
    let status = AuthorizationCenter.shared.authorizationStatus
    print("Status: \(status.rawValue)")
    print("0=notDetermined, 1=denied, 2=approved")
}
```

---

### Verify Shield Status

```swift
// In AppUsageView or add button to test
Button("Shield Status") {
    let status = viewModel.getShieldStatus()
    print("Blocked: \(status.blocked)")
    print("Accessible: \(status.accessible)")
}
```

---

### Monitor Extension Events

```swift
// In ScreenTimeService.swift - Already implemented
// Watch console for:
[ScreenTimeService] Event threshold reached: usage.learning
[ScreenTimeService] Recording usage with duration: 60 seconds
```

---

### Test Without Real Apps (DEBUG Only)

```swift
#if DEBUG
// In AppUsageView, add test button:
Button("Test Data") {
    viewModel.configureWithTestApplications()
}

// This creates fake usage data:
// - Books: 1 hour learning
// - Calculator: 10 minutes learning
// - Music: 30 minutes reward
#endif
```
