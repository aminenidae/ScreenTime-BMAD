# ScreenTime Rewards - Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for the ScreenTime Rewards application, focusing on verifying the DeviceActivity integration and core functionality.

## Current Testing Status

### Phase 1 Complete - ✅
- App launches without crashing
- Main screen displays correctly
- Monitoring controls work (Start/Stop)
- Data reset functionality works
- Time formatting displays correctly
- Sample data loads correctly
- All unit tests pass

### Phase 2 In Progress - DeviceActivity Integration
We are now implementing the actual ScreenTime API integration:

1. **Implement DeviceActivity Integration** - Enabling actual ScreenTime monitoring
2. **Add Family Controls Authorization** - Implementing authorization flows
3. **Implement Real Data Collection** - Replacing simulated data with actual ScreenTime data
4. **Add Data Persistence** - Storing collected data locally
5. **Test with Real Data** - Validating implementation on physical devices

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
The project includes unit tests for:
- AppUsage model initialization and functionality
- Time formatting
- Category management
- Framework import verification
- ScreenTimeService basic functionality

### Integration Tests
- DeviceActivityCenter integration
- Data flow from DeviceActivity to AppUsage
- Family Controls framework integration

### Manual Tests
- UI functionality tests
- Core functionality tests
- Data management tests
- Integration tests

## Current Test Results

### Unit Tests - ✅ All Passing
1. `testAppUsageInitialization` - Pass
2. `testAppUsageSessionTracking` - Pass
3. `testAppCategoryCases` - Pass
4. `testTimeFormatting` - Pass
5. `testTodayUsageCalculation` - Pass
6. `testScreenTimeServiceInitialization` - Pass
7. `testScreenTimeServiceScheduleActivity` - Pass
8. `testScreenTimeServiceStartStopMonitoring` - Pass

### Integration Tests - ⏳ In Progress
1. DeviceActivity event handling
2. Real ScreenTime data collection
3. Family Controls authorization flow

## Testing Checklist - Phase 2

### DeviceActivity Integration
- [x] DeviceActivityCenter initializes correctly
- [x] scheduleActivity method executes without errors
- [x] startMonitoring/stopMonitoring methods execute without errors
- [ ] DeviceActivityDelegate methods receive events
- [ ] Actual usage data is collected from DeviceActivity
- [ ] Data is properly processed and stored

### Family Controls Integration
- [ ] Family Controls framework imports correctly
- [ ] Authorization view can be presented
- [ ] Permission requests work correctly
- [ ] Family setup functions properly

### Data Collection
- [ ] App usage data is collected accurately
- [ ] Time tracking is precise
- [ ] Category assignment works correctly
- [ ] Data persistence functions properly

## Next Steps

1. Implement DeviceActivityDelegate methods to handle activity events
2. Add data collection from DeviceActivity events
3. Implement Family Controls authorization flow
4. Replace simulated data with actual ScreenTime data
5. Run comprehensive integration tests
6. Test on physical devices with real ScreenTime data

## Testing on Physical Devices

The ScreenTime APIs require a physical device to function properly. Testing on the Simulator will not provide accurate results for ScreenTime functionality.

### Device Testing Requirements
- iOS 14.0+ device
- Family Sharing enabled
- Screen Time enabled
- Parental controls configured

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data
During development, we use mock data to simulate app usage:
- Educational apps: Books, Calculator
- Entertainment apps: Music
- Productivity apps: Calendar, Notes

### Real Data
Once DeviceActivity integration is complete, we'll collect real usage data:
- Actual bundle identifiers
- Real usage times
- True app categories
- User-specific data

## Quality Assurance

### Code Coverage
- Target: 80%+ code coverage
- Focus on critical paths
- Edge case handling
- Error condition testing

### Performance Testing
- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU consumption tracking
- Response time measurement
- Battery impact assessment

### Security Testing
- Data privacy compliance
- Secure storage verification
- Permission handling validation
- Family sharing security

## Reporting

Test results will be documented in:
- `/docs/test-results/`
- Individual test reports per feature
- Summary reports per sprint
- Bug reports in GitHub issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Issues

1. **Framework Import Failures**
   - Verify DeviceActivity and FamilyControls frameworks are linked
   - Check deployment target compatibility
   - Ensure proper entitlements

2. **DeviceActivity Integration Issues**
   - Confirm physical device testing
   - Verify Family Controls capability
   - Check authorization flow implementation

3. **Data Collection Problems**
   - Validate DeviceActivityDelegate implementation
   - Confirm data processing logic
   - Check storage mechanisms

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Simulator Testing**
   - Use iOS 14.0+ simulators
   - Limited ScreenTime functionality
   - Useful for UI testing

2. **Physical Device Testing**
   - Required for ScreenTime APIs
   - iOS 14.0+ devices
   - Family Sharing configured
   - Screen Time enabled

## Test Automation

### Continuous Integration
- Automated unit test execution
- Code coverage reporting
- Build status monitoring
- Deployment validation

### Test Scripts
- Build verification scripts
- Automated test execution
- Result aggregation
- Reporting generation

## Conclusion

This testing plan ensures comprehensive validation of the ScreenTime Rewards application. As we progress through Phase 2 implementation, we'll update this plan with specific test cases for the DeviceActivity integration and Family Controls features.
