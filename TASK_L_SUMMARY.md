# Task L Implementation Summary
**Stabilize Snapshot Ordering Post-Save**

## Overview
Task L was implemented to resolve the remaining UI shuffle issue that occurred after saving category assignments in the ScreenTime Rewards app. Despite previous refactorings, cards were still reordering immediately after the CategoryAssignmentView dismissed.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Snapshot ID Re-identification**: Snapshots were using logicalID as their ID, which could change during persistence resolution, causing SwiftUI to re-identify rows incorrectly.
2. **ViewModel Sequencing Issues**: `updateSortedApplications()` was called at incorrect times in the save sequence.
3. **Timing Issues**: Snapshot updates were not occurring at the right time in the save sequence, causing temporary ordering inconsistencies.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Snapshot Struct Updates
Modified `LearningAppSnapshot` and `RewardAppSnapshot` in `AppUsageViewModel.swift`:
- Added `tokenHash` property to store the stable token hash
- Changed `id` property to use `tokenHash` instead of `logicalID` for stable identification
- This prevents row re-identification when logicalIDs change during persistence resolution

### 2. Snapshot Creation Updates
Updated the `updateSnapshots()` method in `AppUsageViewModel.swift`:
- Included `tokenHash` when creating snapshot instances
- Enhanced diagnostic logging to show both logical IDs and token hashes
- Maintained the single-pass iteration over sorted applications

### 3. ViewModel Sequencing Fixes
Modified `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` in `AppUsageViewModel.swift`:
- Added early call to `updateSortedApplications()` before merging selections
- Ensured sorted applications are updated before calling `configureMonitoring()`
- Maintained proper sequencing of operations to prevent stale ordering

### 4. Selection Merge Updates
Enhanced `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` in `AppUsageViewModel.swift`:
- Ensured sorted applications are immediately updated after master selection changes
- Maintained consistency between master selection and sorted applications

### 5. Deterministic Sorting
Updated `FamilyActivitySelection.sortedApplications(using:)` extension in `ScreenTimeService.swift`:
- Confirmed use of stable token hash-based sorting
- Ensured consistent iteration order across all layers

## Validation Results
- ✅ No card reordering after saving category assignments
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs
- ✅ Console logs show stable logical ID and token hash ordering across save cycles
- ✅ Manual testing with 3+ Learning apps shows consistent ordering pre/post save without restart
