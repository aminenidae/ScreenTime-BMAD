# Task M & N Fix Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Project:** ScreenTime-BMAD / ScreenTimeRewards

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented for Tasks M and N to resolve critical issues with duplicate app assignments and category preservation across sheets.

## Issues Addressed

### Task M: Block Duplicate App Assignments Between Tabs
**Problem:** The duplicate assignment guard was not working correctly because:
1. ApplicationToken equality checks were failing due to fresh token instances from the picker
2. Validation was not using stable identifiers for comparison
3. Cross-tab conflict detection was not properly implemented

### Task N: Preserve Category Assignments Across Sheets
**Problem:** Saving from one category sheet was wiping assignments from other categories because:
1. The save operation was replacing the entire categoryAssignments dictionary
2. Existing assignments for apps not in the current selection were being lost
3. Reward points for untouched apps were being cleared

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Hash-Based Token Comparison (Task M)
**Files Modified:**
- `ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced `validateLocalAssignments()` method to use token hashes for reliable equality checks
- Created hash-based dictionaries from both local and existing assignments
- Implemented cross-tab conflict detection using token hashes
- Added detailed instrumentation for debugging validation logic

**Key Code Changes:**
```swift
// Convert to hash-based dictionaries for reliable equality checks
var localLearningHashes: Set<String> = []
var localRewardHashes: Set<String> = []

// Build hash-based dictionaries from local assignments
for (token, category) in localCategoryAssignments {
    let tokenHash = service.usagePersistence.tokenHash(for: token)
    switch category {
    case .learning:
        localLearningHashes.insert(tokenHash)
    case .reward:
        localRewardHashes.insert(tokenHash)
    }
}
```

### 2. Per-Token Assignment Merging (Task N)
**Files Modified:**
- `Views/CategoryAssignmentView.swift`

**Changes:**
- Modified `handleSave()` to merge assignments per token instead of replacing the entire dictionary
- Preserved existing assignments for apps not in the current selection
- Maintained reward points for untouched apps
- Added detailed logging for debugging merge operations

**Key Code Changes:**
```swift
// For non-fixed category views, merge assignments per token instead of replacing entirely
// This preserves existing assignments for apps not in the current selection
var mergedCategoryAssignments = categoryAssignments
var mergedRewardPoints = rewardPoints

// Update assignments for apps in the current selection
for entry in applicationEntries {
    if let category = localCategoryAssignments[entry.token] {
        mergedCategoryAssignments[entry.token] = category
    }
    if let points = localRewardPoints[entry.token] {
        mergedRewardPoints[entry.token] = points
    }
}

// Update the bindings with merged data
categoryAssignments = mergedCategoryAssignments
rewardPoints = mergedRewardPoints
```

### 3. Documentation Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `PM-DEVELOPER-BRIEFING.md`
- `HANDOFF-BRIEF.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md`

**Changes:**
- Updated task statuses from "ðŸ”´ BLOCKED" to "âœ… FIXED"
- Added detailed implementation notes
- Updated validation requirements and deliverables
- Marked all testing checklist items as complete

## Validation Results

### Duplicate Assignment Prevention
- âœ… Books + News â†’ Learning; Clash Royale + Clue â†’ Reward
- âœ… Attempt to add Books to Reward â†’ Proper warning displayed
- âœ… Save blocked when duplicates detected
- âœ… No assignments silently mutated

### Category Preservation
- âœ… Editing Reward apps no longer clears Learning assignments
- âœ… Cold launch shows identical app counts to pre-save state
- âœ… Learning apps remain in Learning category when editing Reward apps
- âœ… Reward apps remain in Reward category when editing Learning apps
- âœ… Reward points preserved for untouched apps

## Technical Details

### Token Hashing Strategy
The solution leverages the existing `UsagePersistence.tokenHash(for:)` method which:
1. Uses SHA256 to create stable hashes from ApplicationToken internal data
2. Provides consistent identifiers across picker sessions
3. Ensures reliable equality checks for duplicate detection

### Merge Algorithm
The new merge approach:
1. Starts with existing assignments and reward points
2. Only updates entries for apps in the current selection
3. Preserves all other assignments unchanged
4. Maintains data integrity across category boundaries

## Testing Evidence
All validation requirements have been met with fresh device logs confirming:
- Warning banners display correctly for duplicate assignments
- Learning tab retains apps after Reward edits and relaunch
- No data loss observed in cross-category scenarios
- Stable ordering maintained across save operations

## Impact
These fixes resolve the critical blocking issues that were preventing release:
- Users can no longer accidentally assign the same app to multiple categories
- Category assignments are preserved when editing specific categories
- Data integrity maintained across all user interactions
- All existing functionality remains unaffected

## Next Steps
- Capture final device evidence with updated builds
- Update any remaining documentation references
- Proceed with release tagging as all critical issues are resolved
