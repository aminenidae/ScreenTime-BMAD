# Task 0 Completion Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Project:** ScreenTime-BMAD / ScreenTimeRewards
**Task:** Share a Single AppUsageViewModel Across Tabs (CRITICAL)

## Overview
Task 0 has been successfully completed. The implementation now uses a single shared `AppUsageViewModel` instance across all tabs, ensuring data consistency and enabling proper duplicate detection. Additionally, the sheet presentation has been refactored to use a single consolidated sheet based on the active picker context.

## Problem Statement
Previously, the Learning and Reward tabs each created their own `AppUsageViewModel` instance. This caused data inconsistency where `categoryAssignments` never contained both categories simultaneously. The duplicate guard only saw one side of the data and couldn't detect cross-category conflicts. Additionally, each tab had its own sheet implementation, leading to duplicate code and potential inconsistencies.

The specific issues that needed to be fixed were:
- When the Learning picker dismissed, the sheet still rendered the reward view (fixedCategory: .reward), so the UI showed cost-per-minute instead of earn-per-minute.
- Later, tapping "View All ..." dumped all assignments into one sheet, because both tabs still declare their own .sheet bound to the shared viewModel.isCategoryAssignmentPresented. SwiftUI tries to present twice; the first presenter wins, but both contexts feed the same view, so categories blend together.
- The duplicate guard still never fires: the validator keeps logging "Stored assignments count: 0" when the reward sheet opens, meaning it only sees reward entries at that moment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Shared ViewModel in App Entry Point
Modified `ScreenTimeRewardsApp.swift` to create a single `@StateObject` instance:
```swift
@main
struct ScreenTimeRewardsApp: App {
    let persistenceController = PersistenceController.shared
    @StateObject private var viewModel = AppUsageViewModel()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MainTabView()
                .environment(\.managedObjectContext, persistenceController.container.viewContext)
                .environmentObject(viewModel)  // Inject shared view model
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Environment Object Propagation
Updated `MainTabView.swift` to receive and propagate the shared view model:
```swift
struct MainTabView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var viewModel: AppUsageViewModel  // Receive shared view model
    
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            RewardsTabView()
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Rewards", systemImage: "gamecontroller.fill")
                }

            LearningTabView()
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Learning", systemImage: "book.fill")
                }
        }
        .environmentObject(viewModel)  // Pass shared view model to tabs
    }
}
```

### 3. View Updates
Updated both `LearningTabView.swift` and `RewardsTabView.swift` to use `@EnvironmentObject`:
```swift
struct LearningTabView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var viewModel: AppUsageViewModel  // Use shared view model
    // ... rest of implementation
}

struct RewardsTabView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var viewModel: AppUsageViewModel  // Use shared view model
    // ... rest of implementation
}
```

### 4. Consolidated Sheet Presentation
Added a computed property to `AppUsageViewModel.swift` to expose the active picker context:
```swift
// Task 0: Expose active picker context for sheet presentation
var currentPickerContext: PickerContext? {
    activePickerContext
}
```

Moved the sheet implementation to `MainTabView.swift` with conditional logic based on the active picker context:
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $viewModel.isCategoryAssignmentPresented) {
    // Task 0: Consolidated sheet based on activePickerContext
    Group {
        if viewModel.currentPickerContext == .learning {
            CategoryAssignmentView(
                selection: viewModel.familySelection,
                categoryAssignments: $viewModel.categoryAssignments,
                rewardPoints: $viewModel.rewardPoints,
                fixedCategory: .learning,
                usageTimes: viewModel.getUsageTimes(),
                onSave: {
                    viewModel.onCategoryAssignmentSave()
                    viewModel.startMonitoring()
                },
                onCancel: {
                    viewModel.cancelCategoryAssignment()
                }
            )
        } else {
            CategoryAssignmentView(
                selection: viewModel.familySelection,
                categoryAssignments: $viewModel.categoryAssignments,
                rewardPoints: $viewModel.rewardPoints,
                fixedCategory: .reward,  // Auto-categorize as Reward
                usageTimes: viewModel.getUsageTimes(),  // Pass usage times for display
                onSave: {
                    viewModel.onCategoryAssignmentSave()

                    // Immediately shield (block) reward apps
                    viewModel.blockRewardApps()

                    // Start monitoring usage
                    viewModel.startMonitoring()
                },
                onCancel: {
                    viewModel.cancelCategoryAssignment()
                }
            )
        }
    }
    .environmentObject(viewModel)  // Task M: Pass ViewModel reference to CategoryAssignmentView
}
```

Removed the duplicate sheet implementations from both `LearningTabView.swift` and `RewardsTabView.swift`.

### 5. Fixed Context Management for "View All" Actions
Added specific methods to `AppUsageViewModel.swift` to properly set the active picker context when showing all apps:
```swift
// Task 0: Add methods to show category assignment view with proper context
func showAllLearningApps() {
    activePickerContext = .learning
    isCategoryAssignmentPresented = true
}

func showAllRewardApps() {
    activePickerContext = .reward
    isCategoryAssignmentPresented = true
}
```

Updated the "View All" buttons in both tab views to use these new methods instead of directly setting the `isCategoryAssignmentPresented` property.

## Results

### Before Implementation
- Each tab created its own `AppUsageViewModel` instance
- Data inconsistency between tabs
- Duplicate detection failed to see cross-category conflicts
- Changes in one tab weren't immediately reflected in the other
- Duplicate sheet implementations in both tabs
- Wrong category view shown after picker dismissal
- "View All" actions didn't set proper context, causing UI confusion
- Duplicate guard never fired because it only saw one category at a time

### After Implementation
- Single `AppUsageViewModel` instance shared across all views
- Data consistency maintained between tabs
- Duplicate detection sees both Learning and Reward assignments simultaneously
- Real-time data synchronization between tabs
- Changes in one tab immediately reflected in the other
- Single consolidated sheet implementation based on active picker context
- Elimination of duplicate code
- Correct category view shown based on active picker context
- "View All" actions properly set context for correct UI display
- Duplicate guard now works correctly as it sees both categories

## Validation
- ✅ Build succeeds with no compilation errors
- ✅ Single ViewModel instance shared across all views
- ✅ Data changes in one tab immediately reflected in the other
- ✅ Duplicate detection now works correctly across categories
- ✅ Single consolidated sheet presentation works correctly
- ✅ Correct category view shown based on active picker context
- ✅ "View All" actions properly set context for correct UI display
- ✅ No performance degradation observed

## Files Modified
1. `ScreenTimeRewards/ScreenTimeRewardsApp.swift`
2. `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/MainTabView.swift`
3. `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/LearningTabView.swift`
4. `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/RewardsTabView.swift`
5. `ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift`

## Impact
This implementation resolves the critical issue that was preventing proper duplicate detection. With a single shared ViewModel, the duplicate guard can now see both Learning and Reward assignments simultaneously and correctly block conflicting saves. This fix was essential for the proper functioning of Tasks M and N. The consolidated sheet presentation also improves code maintainability and reduces duplication. The proper context management ensures that the correct UI is shown in all scenarios.
