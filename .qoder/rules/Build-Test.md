## Build and Test Policy

Given the current phase of development and the nature of the changes being made, we will adopt a cautious approach:

- **No Automated Builds or Tests**: We will not trigger any automated build processes or run tests at this time.
- **Manual Verification**: All builds and tests will be conducted manually by the developer on Xcode using a physical device.
- **Error Reporting**: If any issues arise during the manual build or test process, the developer will provide the full build log for further analysis and troubleshooting.

This approach ensures that we maintain control over the testing environment and can address any potential issues promptly without relying on automated systems that may not yet be fully configured or reliable.
