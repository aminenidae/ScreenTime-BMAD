## ✨ KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### 1. Trust
The app should feel professional, warm, and trustworthy. Like Headspace or Apple Health.

### 2. Progress
Parents need to see progress everywhere. Progress = Control = Confidence.

### 3. Celebration
Every milestone should feel earned and celebrated. Learning should be rewarded.

### 4. Clarity
Information hierarchy should be obvious. No confusion about what's important.

### 5. Accessibility
WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 contrast, 44px touch targets, dark mode support).

## 📊 EXPECTED IMPACT

When design system is properly implemented:

- **Onboarding completion**: 65% (vs. 45% current) = +44%
- **Trial start rate**: 40% (vs. 10% current) = +300%
- **Paid conversion**: 25-30% (vs. 3-5% current) = **5-7x improvement**

---

## 🎓 DESIGN SYSTEM AS MARKETING

This isn't just a UI system. It's part of your marketing strategy.

**Every design decision is psychological**:
- Teal colors communicate growth (not surveillance)
- Progress indicators everywhere build confidence
- Celebration moments create emotional connection
- Warm grays feel intimate (not clinical)

The design *makes your value proposition visible*.
