**Created**: December 14, 2025

**Key Design Decisions & Psychology**:

1. **Why Teal-Green?**
   - Associated with growth & learning (not surveillance blue)
   - Psychology: Growth, healing, trust
   - Not corporate (Microsoft/IBM blue)
   - Not childish (neon colors)
   - Science: Green reduces anxiety

2. **Why Progress Visible Everywhere?**
   - Parents want to see control
   - Progress = Confidence = Trust
   - Visual feedback = Dopamine hit
   - Every screen shows progress being made

3. **Why Celebration Moments Matter?**
   - Reinforces positive behavior
   - Creates emotional connection
   - Builds habit loop
   - Makes app feel rewarding to check

4. **Why Warm Grays Not Pure White?**
   - Pure white is harsh (clinical)
   - Warm grays feel intimate, safe
   - Reduces eye strain
   - Psychological warmth = trust

5. **Why SF Pro Display + Inter?**
   - Premium feel (not generic)
   - High readability (not trendy)
   - Accessible (great contrast)
   - SF Pro = native feel (iOS trust)
   - Inter = modern + clean

6. **Why Card Design with Shadows?**
   - Depth = Organization
   - Shadows = Elevation = Importance
   - Not flat (too harsh)
   - Not skeuomorphic (too dated)

**Result**: Design that communicates Trust + Control + Progress at a glance.
