## 🎯 Current Sprint Goal

**Eliminate the immediate post-"Save & Monitor" shuffle on the Learning and Rewards tabs by introducing deterministic, snapshot-based ordering across service, view model, and SwiftUI layers.**

---

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### What's Working ✅
1. **Token persistence** survives cold launches; usage totals reload correctly.
2. **Background tracking** records usage while the UI is closed.
3. **Monitoring auto-restart** (DeviceActivity) continues after relaunches.
4. **UUID collision** was resolved on Oct 19; new apps now start at 0 s / 0 pts.
5. **Rewards/Learning tab refactors** (Oct 20 morning) compile cleanly after we broke the giant SwiftUI bodies into helper builders.

### What's Broken 🔴
- **UI shuffle persists after "Save & Monitor".** Reproduced again at 12:45 PM: logs show ScreenTimeService delivering correct app data, but the SwiftUI lists reorder cards right after the save action. Restarting the app restores the correct mapping, so persistence is fine; the live ordering is not.

### Summary of Root Cause
- `categoryAssignments` and `rewardPoints` are dictionaries. When we filter them (`learningApps`, `rewardApps`) and enumerate, the order mirrors the dictionary's internal hashing, which changes whenever the selection Set mutates. The SwiftUI `ForEach` currently depends on that unstable order, so rows jump around as soon as we add/remove apps.
- We must provide a **stable snapshot** (sorted array) sourced from the same ordering logic in both the service and the view model, then render strictly from that snapshot.

### Evidence
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_12-39-58--0500.xcresult` – data loads correctly after refactor.
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.20_12-33-29--0500.xcresult` – shows correct usage recorded prior to relaunch.
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.20_12-39-58--0500.xcresult` + 12:41 PM screenshot – demonstrates persistence is stable but order still shifts post-save.
- Latest manual test (12:45 PM) confirmed shuffle still occurs immediately after pressing "Save & Monitor".

## 📋 Developer Tasks – UPDATED 2025-10-20 12:55 PM
**STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅**

### Task A — Rebuild Snapshot Pipeline (CRITICAL) ✅
**Files:** `ScreenTimeService.swift`, `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

1. ✅ Keep the shared sorted helper (`tokenHash`-based) and ensure every service iteration uses it. Confirm we remove/replace existing `appUsages[logicalID]` entries instead of appending duplicates when `configureMonitoring` runs.
2. ✅ Replace the token-only arrays with rich snapshot structs, e.g.:
   ```swift
   struct LearningAppSnapshot: Identifiable {
       let token: ManagedSettings.ApplicationToken
       let logicalID: String
       let displayName: String
       let pointsPerMinute: Int
       let totalSeconds: TimeInterval
       var id: String { logicalID }
   }
   ```
3. ✅ Build `learningSnapshots` / `rewardSnapshots` from a single pass over the sorted applications: resolve logical ID via `usagePersistence`, pull usage from `appUsages[logicalID]` (default to zero), and look up the assigned points. No dictionary filtering/`enumerated()` calls.
4. ✅ Refresh these snapshots whenever `familySelection`, `categoryAssignments`, or `rewardPoints` change so they stay in sync immediately after "Save & Monitor".

**Deliverable:** Deterministic snapshot arrays without duplicate logical IDs and matching service output.

---

### Task B — Render Directly from Snapshots (CRITICAL) ✅
**Files:** `LearningTabView.swift`, `RewardsTabView.swift`

1. ✅ Replace all `ForEach(Array(...enumerated()))` usage with `ForEach(viewModel.learningSnapshots)` / `.rewardSnapshots`, using `.id(\.id)` (logical ID) for stability.
2. ✅ Bind each row directly to the snapshot fields (display name, formatted `totalSeconds`, `pointsPerMinute`, icon via `Label(token)`), eliminating any dictionary lookups or `getUsageTimes()` calls.
3. ✅ Keep the helper-based view structure so the compiler stays happy.

**Deliverable:** SwiftUI lists that render once with correct data (no duplicate rows, no shuffling) immediately after "Save & Monitor".

---

### Task C — Device Validation (MUST PASS) ⏳
**STATUS: PENDING VALIDATION**

1. Configure three learning apps with distinct point/min values. Hit "Save & Monitor" and confirm the order remains unchanged immediately after the save.
2. Repeat for reward apps.
3. Capture `.xcresult` logs and a screenshot showing the stable order.
4. Add findings to the Task Log with timestamps.

**Success Criteria:** No shuffle without relaunching.

---

### Task D — Documentation Follow-Up ⏳
**STATUS: PENDING VALIDATION COMPLETION**

1. Once Task C passes, update:
   - `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` (Known Issues) – mark the shuffle bug resolved and document the approach.
   - `../HANDOFF-BRIEF.md` – summarize the fix and validation evidence.
2. Note completion in this briefing under "Issues Identified".

**Deliverable:** Documentation edits + mention in Task Log.

---

### Task E — Restore Live Usage Refresh (CRITICAL) ✅
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `ScreenTimeService.swift`

✔ Service now updates `appUsages` in place (no duplicate logical IDs).
✔ Snapshots rebuild on `usageDidChange` / `refreshData()`.
✔ Foreground usage reflects immediately without restart.

---

### Task F — Validate Removal Flow (CRITICAL) ✅
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `LearningTabView.swift`

1. ✅ Remove one or more learning apps via the picker, tap "Save & Monitor", and confirm the Learning tab updates instantly (no restart).
2. ✅ Ensure snapshots drop entries for removed logical IDs and that `appUsages` no longer contains orphaned records.
3. ✅ Capture `.xcresult`, console snippet, and screenshot showing the updated list.

**Deliverable:** Immediate UI update when learning apps are removed.

---

### Task G — Unlock All Reward Apps Control (HIGH) ✅
**Files:** `RewardsTabView.swift`, `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

1. ✅ Add an "Unlock All Reward Apps" button to the Rewards tab that calls `unlockRewardApps()`.
2. ✅ Display the button only when reward apps are currently locked/selected; hide or disable otherwise.
3. ✅ Validate on-device and document with `.xcresult`, console log, and screenshot.

**Deliverable:** Reward tab provides a quick unlock action that takes effect immediately.

---

### Task H — Isolate Picker Selection per Category (CRITICAL) ✅
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `LearningTabView.swift`, `RewardsTabView.swift`

1. ✅ Introduce separate selection state for learning vs reward flows (e.g., `learningSelection`, `rewardSelection`, or a dedicated `SelectionContext`).
2. ✅ When presenting the Reward picker, initialize it with only reward-assigned tokens; ensure learning tokens remain untouched. Bind the picker to the reward-specific selection rather than the global `familySelection`.
3. ✅ After the Reward assignment is saved, merge learning + reward selections back into the master `familySelection` before scheduling monitoring.
4. ✅ Validate that opening the Reward picker shows only reward apps preselected, while the Learning picker still shows learning apps. Capture `.xcresult` and screenshots of both flows.

**Deliverable:** Reward picker no longer preselects learning apps; both flows coexist without data loss.

---

### Task I — Fix CategoryAssignmentView Compilation (BLOCKING) ✅
**Files:** `CategoryAssignmentView.swift`

1. ✅ Break up the large SwiftUI body near line 17 into smaller helper views (similar to the Learning/Rewards refactors) so the compiler can type-check it.
2. ✅ Replace the deprecated `navigationViewStyle(.stack)` call (if needed) with the modern API. Ensure any `sheet`/`NavigationView` usage compiles under iOS 16+.
3. ✅ Address the missing `using:` argument errors at lines ~167 and ~190—likely caused by updated `ForEach`/`List` signatures. Supply the new parameter or switch to the new initializer.
4. ✅ Rebuild to confirm the warnings are resolved and no new errors appear. Capture the updated build log.

**Deliverable:** Clean build with `CategoryAssignmentView` compiling successfully.

---

### Task J — Tag Release v0.0.7-alpha ✅
1. ✅ Checkout commit `a9863cd` locally (`git checkout a9863cd`).
2. ✅ Create an annotated tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.0.7-alpha a9863cd -m "Release v0.0.7-alpha"
   ```
3. ✅ Push the tag to GitHub (`git push origin v0.0.7-alpha`).
4. ✅ Confirm the tag appears on the remote.

**Deliverable:** Git tag `v0.0.7-alpha` published pointing to commit `a9863cd`.

---

### Task K — Remove displayName fallback in `UsagePersistence` ✅
**Files:** `ScreenTimeRewards/Shared/UsagePersistence.swift`

1. ✅ In `resolveLogicalID`, delete the branch that reuses an existing app when `displayName` matches (`cachedApps.values.first(where: { $0.displayName == displayName })`).
2. ✅ When no bundle ID exists, always generate a new UUID so privacy-protected apps never collide.
3. ✅ Ensure token mappings persist uniquely (hash → logicalID) and reuse only when the same token hash is seen again.
4. ✅ Rebuild and rerun the Books/News → Translate/Weather scenario; capture `.xcresult` and confirm snapshots show unique logical IDs.

**Deliverable:** Privacy-protected apps receive unique logical IDs; shuffle regression resolved.

## Next Focus — Fix Remaining Shuffle After Refresh (NEW) ⚠️
**Priority:** Critical
**Owner:** Dev Agent
**Target Date:** COMPLETED ✅

### Context Recap
- Pull-to-refresh now calls `AppUsageViewModel.refresh()` so both tabs can request a fresh snapshot without relaunching.
- Despite the snapshot refactor, we still observe card reordering immediately after `CategoryAssignmentView` dismisses. Logs show `sortedApplications` rebuilding, but the published snapshot arrays repopulate in a different sequence.
- Restarting the app corrects the order, which means persistence is solid; the runtime shuffle stems from the view model/service refresh pipeline.

### Task L — Stabilize Snapshot Ordering Post-Save ✅
**STATUS: COMPLETE**

1. **Lock snapshot IDs and sort keys to token hashes.**
   - Updated `LearningAppSnapshot` / `RewardAppSnapshot` so `id` (and any `sortKey`) always uses `service.usagePersistence.tokenHash(for:)`.
   - Thread that hash through `CategoryAssignmentView` (and any helper structs) so every layer iterates in the same canonical order.
2. **Stop logical-ID swaps from re-identifying rows.**
   - Keep `logicalID` for display only; snapshots now use token hash as their stable ID to prevent re-identification when logical IDs change during persistence resolution.
   - Audit `sortedLearningApps` / `sortedRewardApps` and related helpers to ensure they sort by the same hash-based ordering.
3. **Fix ViewModel sequencing issues.**
   - Modified `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` to update sorted applications BEFORE calling `configureMonitoring()` and ensure `masterSelection` reflects the merged selection before any refresh occurs.
   - Updated `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` to immediately update sorted applications after master selection changes.
4. **Enhanced snapshot updates with proper timing.**
   - Ensured snapshot updates occur at the correct time in the save sequence to prevent temporary ordering inconsistencies.
5. **Re-run instrumentation & validation.**
   - Used the existing `📋 Learning snapshot logical IDs` log to capture hash arrays immediately before and after "Save & Monitor". Confirmed the sequence remains identical.
   - Verified that console logs show the same hash ordering pre/post save with no logical-ID swaps.

**Definition of Done:**
- ✅ No card reordering after saving category assignments (first-run scenario).
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs.
- ✅ Console logs show the same hash ordering pre/post save with no logical-ID swaps.
- ✅ Updated tests run without touching real App Group data.
- ✅ Findings documented in `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` with timestamps and linked `.xcresult` files.

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist (All must pass)
- [x] Add/remove apps repeatedly without shuffle or stale data (Task F).
- [x] Reward picker opens with only reward apps selected (Task H).
- [x] Cold launch regression (ensure ordering persists across restarts).
- [x] Background accumulation regression (ensure usage still records correctly post-refactor).
- [x] No card reordering after saving category assignments (Task L).
- [x] Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs (Task L).

### Reporting Requirements
- Attach `.xcresult` logs for every validation run (shuffle, live-update, removal, and unlock scenarios).
- Provide before/after screenshots demonstrating stable ordering, live updates, and unlock behaviour.
