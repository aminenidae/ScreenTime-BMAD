## 🎯 Current Sprint Status

**✅ PHASE 0: DEVICE SELECTION & MODE MANAGEMENT COMPLETED** ⭐ NEW

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-27

Phase 0 of the CloudKit Remote Monitoring implementation has been successfully completed. This foundational phase implemented device selection and mode management, which is essential for all subsequent phases.

**✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXES COMPLETED** ⭐ NEW

**Fix Date:** 2025-10-26

Four critical bugs in points calculation and state persistence have been identified and fixed:
1. ✅ **Retroactive Points Recalculation** - Points now locked in when earned
2. ✅ **Configuration Reload** - Rate changes apply immediately to in-memory state
3. ✅ **App Card Display** - Views show actual earned points, not recalculated values
4. ✅ **Unlocked App Persistence** - Unlocked reward apps maintain state across app restarts

**Detailed Analysis:** `/Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/POINTS-CALCULATION-BUG-FIXES.md`

**✅ REWARD TRANSFER SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED**

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-25

The reward point transfer feature has been successfully implemented and builds without errors. This Phase 2 enhancement allows users to transfer reward points between apps and categories.

**✅ CATEGORY SELECTION ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-25

After exploring experimental approaches, we discovered the official Apple solution: the `includeEntireCategory` flag in `FamilyActivitySelection`. This has been successfully implemented across the entire codebase.

## 📊 Current State Snapshot

### What's Working ✅
- **Phase 0 completed** ⭐ Device selection and mode management implemented
- **All critical bugs fixed** ⭐ Points calculation, configuration reload, UI display, and state persistence working correctly
- **Reward transfer system operational** - Point transfer feature builds successfully
- **Category selection fully operational** - Users can now select entire categories and the system automatically expands them to individual app tokens
- `includeEntireCategory: true` flag implemented in all 21+ `FamilyActivitySelection` initializations
- JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder already in use (avoiding PropertyListEncoder bug that would drop the flag)
- Monitoring, persistence, and cross-category guards remain stable
- All core functionality working as expected
- Experimental tab removed (no longer needed)

### Recent Fixes (Oct 26, 2025) ⭐
- ✅ Points now use **stored property** with **incremental tracking** (not retroactive recalculation)
- ✅ Configuration changes reload from persistence (immediate effect)
- ✅ App cards display actual `earnedPoints` (not calculated values)
- ✅ Unlocked apps use **stable SHA-256 token hash** (persist across restarts)

### Critical Discovery 🔍

**The Official Apple Solution:**

According to Apple's FamilyControls documentation and developer community findings:
- When `FamilyActivitySelection` is initialized with `includeEntireCategory: true`, category selections automatically expand to include all individual app tokens
- Available since iOS 15.2+
- This is the **official, supported** Apple approach for handling category selections

**Implementation Pattern:**
``swift
@State var selection = FamilyActivitySelection(includeEntireCategory: true)
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Works with Apple's privacy-focused design
- ✅ No workarounds or hacks required
- ✅ Automatically handles category → app token expansion
- ✅ Persists correctly when using JSONEncoder (not PropertyListEncoder)
- ✅ Simple one-line change per initialization

**Reference Documentation:**
- Investigation Report: `/Users/ameen/Downloads/Handling Category Selections in iOS FamilyControls (Screen Time API).pdf`
- Apple Documentation: `FamilyActivitySelection.includeEntireCategory` (iOS 15.2+)

---

## 📝 QA Verification Update (Oct 26, 2025)

- Manual regression pass completed for the Oct 26 point-tracking changes (model and view-model scenarios).
- No additional developer QA tasks required at this time; automated coverage remains a potential future enhancement if desired.

### ✅ Points Calculation Bug Fixes (2025-10-26) ⭐ NEW

**Status:** COMPLETED AND TESTED

**Summary:** Fixed four critical bugs affecting points calculation, state management, and UI display.

#### Bug 1: Retroactive Points Recalculation ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** `earnedRewardPoints` was a computed property that recalculated all historical usage with current rate.

**Example of Bug:**
```
Minute 1 at 75 pts/min → Total: 75 pts ✅
Change to 230 pts/min
Minute 2 → Total: 150 pts ❌ (expected 305)
Minute 3 → Total: 225 pts ❌ (expected 535)
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `earnedRewardPoints` from computed to stored property
- Added incremental calculation in `recordUsage()` method
- Updated all initializers and persistence logic

**Files Modified:**
- `Models/AppUsage.swift` - Lines 95, 83, 129, 141, 150, 186-188
- `Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` - Lines 338, 349, 360, 649, 1315-1326, 1536-1547, 1600-1611

#### Bug 2: Configuration Reload ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** When user changed points/minute, new rate saved to disk but in-memory `AppUsage` kept old rate.

**Fix Applied:**
- Always reload `AppUsage` from persistence after configuration changes
- Ensures in-memory state matches disk state

**Files Modified:**
- `Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` - Lines 612-617

#### Bug 3: App Card Display ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** App cards recalculated points using current rate instead of showing actual earned.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `earnedPoints` field to `LearningAppSnapshot` and `RewardAppSnapshot`
- Views now display stored `snapshot.earnedPoints` instead of calculating

**Files Modified:**
- `ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` - Lines 14, 26, 490, 500, 512
- `Views/LearningTabView.swift` - Line 180

#### Bug 4: Unlocked Reward Apps Persistence ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Unlocked reward apps appeared locked after app relaunch (used unstable `token.hashValue`).

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `UnlockedRewardApp` to use stable SHA-256 `tokenHash` instead of `hashValue`
- Updated unlock and load flows to use stable hashing

**Files Modified:**
- `Models/AppUsage.swift` - Lines 41, 50
- `ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` - Lines 1523-1526, 1670-1671

**Impact:**
- ✅ Points are now "locked in" when earned - rate changes only affect future usage
- ✅ Configuration changes take effect immediately
- ✅ UI displays consistent values across all screens
- ✅ Unlocked apps maintain state across app restarts

**Documentation:** `/Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/POINTS-CALCULATION-BUG-FIXES.md`

### ✅ Category Selection Fix Implementation (2025-10-25)

**Status:** COMPLETED AND VERIFIED WORKING

**Files Modified:**
1. `ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` (11 instances updated)
2. `ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` (3 instances updated)
3. `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/LearningTabView.swift` (1 instance updated)
4. `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/RewardsTabView.swift` (1 instance updated)
5. `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/CategoryAssignmentView.swift` (1 instance updated)
6. `ScreenTimeRewards/Views/MainTabView.swift` (experimental tab removed)

**Total Instances Updated:** 21+ FamilyActivitySelection initializations

**Changes Made:**
- Updated all `FamilyActivitySelection()` initializations to `FamilyActivitySelection(includeEntireCategory: true)`
- Verified JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder usage (correct, no changes needed)
- Removed experimental tab and ExperimentalCategoryExpansionView.swift (no longer needed)

**Verification:**
- ✅ User confirmed "It's WORKING!!!!!"
- ✅ Category selections now properly expand to individual app tokens
- ✅ Persistence working correctly across app restarts

---

## 🔄 Previous Experimental Approach (Obsoleted)

**Initial Strategy (OBSOLETED):**
We initially explored a "master selection seeding" approach to work around the perceived limitation of category tokens not expanding to app tokens.

**Tasks EXP-1 through EXP-8:** No longer needed - replaced by official Apple solution

**Why We Abandoned It:**
- Discovered the `includeEntireCategory` flag is the official, supported Apple solution
- Master selection seeding was a workaround for a problem that Apple already solved
- Official solution is simpler, cleaner, and officially supported

## 📋 CURRENT PRIORITIES

### 🚨 CRITICAL BUGS IN REWARD TRANSFER SYSTEM

**Tested on Device:** 2025-10-25 00:56:26

**Test Scenario:**
1. Added all Apple Game category apps to Reward category
2. Added all Apple Education category apps to Learning category
3. Attributed 75 points/min to 1 reward app
4. Ran learning apps for 4 minutes → earned 300 points
5. Redeemed 75 points for 15 minutes for one reward app → shield lifted on that app
6. Ran the unlocked reward app for 2 minutes (consuming 10 points: 2 min × 5 pts/min)
7. Locked the app back and attempted to return remaining points

**Issue 1: Incorrect Point Return** ❌
- **Expected:** 65 points returned (75 redeemed - 10 consumed)
- **Actual:** 75 points returned (no consumption tracked)
- **Impact:** Users can exploit system by using full time then getting full refund

**Issue 2: Shield Bug - All Apps Unlocked** ❌
- **Expected:** Locked app gets shield back, other reward apps remain shielded
- **Actual:** Locked app gets shield back, BUT all other reward apps get unshielded
- **Impact:** Critical security/parental control breach - all blocked apps become accessible

**Build Log:** `/Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/Build Reports/Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.25_00-56-26--0500.xcresult`

---

## 🎯 Technical Constraints & Learnings

### Apple FamilyControls Framework:
- **Privacy by Design:** App tokens remain opaque (no bundle IDs/names in main app)
- **Display Solution:** Use `Label(token)` to show app names/icons in UI
- **Category Expansion:** Use `includeEntireCategory: true` flag (iOS 15.2+)
- **Persistence:** Must use JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder (PropertyListEncoder drops the flag)
- **Extensions Access:** Shield/DeviceActivity extensions can access app names/IDs

### What We Learned:
1. Always check for official Apple solutions before building workarounds
2. Developer community resources (Stack Overflow, forums) are valuable for discovering API features
3. The `includeEntireCategory` flag has been available since iOS 15.2 but wasn't well-documented
4. PropertyListEncoder has a known bug with this flag - JSONEncoder is required
5. **Never use computed properties for accumulating values** - Use stored properties with incremental updates ⭐
6. **Always reload from persistence after configuration changes** - Don't assume in-memory state is current ⭐
7. **Display stored values in views, never recalculate** - Prevents retroactive calculation bugs ⭐
8. **Use stable hashing (SHA-256) for token identification** - Swift's hashValue changes on each launch ⭐

---

## 🎯 Communication Protocol

**Status Reporting:**
- Report any issues with category selections immediately
- Monitor console logs for expansion behavior
- Test with various category types (Games, Social, Productivity, etc.)
- Verify persistence across app restarts and device reboots

**Success Criteria Met:**

## 🔧 BUG FIXES COMPLETED (Oct 25-26, 2025)

### ✅ BUG FIX-1 (BF-1): Point Consumption Tracking - FIXED

**File:** `ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift`

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The `consumeReservedPoints()` function exists (line 1472) but is **NEVER CALLED**. When a reward app is used, the system tracks usage but doesn't decrement the reserved points.

**Evidence:**
``bash
grep -rn "consumeReservedPoints" ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/ --include="*.swift"
# Result: Only the function definition, no call sites
```

**Current Flow:**
1. `unlockRewardApp()` → reserves 75 points → stores in `unlockedRewardApps[token]`
2. User uses app for 2 minutes → usage tracked BUT points NOT consumed
3. `lockRewardApp()` → reads `unlockedApp.reservedPoints` → still 75 (should be 65)

**Fix Applied:**
Added call to `consumeReservedPoints()` in `handleRewardAppUsage()` method:

**Location:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift:352`
``swift
// BF-1 FIX: Handle reward app usage notification
private func handleRewardAppUsage() {
    // Process each reward app usage entry
    for (logicalID, data) in rewardUsageData {
        if let token = masterSelection.applicationTokens.first(where: { ... }) {
            // Consume reserved points for this reward app
            consumeReservedPoints(token: token, usageSeconds: usageSeconds)
        }
    }
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Points are consumed as reward apps are used
- ✅ Auto-lock when reserved points reach 0
- ✅ Correct remaining points returned when manually locked

---

### ✅ BUG FIX-2 (BF-2): Shield Management - FIXED

**File:** `ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift`

**Root Cause Analysis:**
In `blockRewardApps()` function (line 1034), the code REPLACES the entire shield set instead of ADDING to it:

**Problematic Code (Line 1041):**
```swift
func blockRewardApps(tokens: Set<ApplicationToken>) {
    currentlyShielded = tokens  // ❌ BUG: Assignment replaces entire set
    managedSettingsStore.shield.applications = tokens
}
```

**Why This Breaks:**
1. Initial state: Apps A, B, C are all shielded → `currentlyShielded = {A, B, C}`
2. User unlocks app A → `unblockRewardApps([A])` → `currentlyShielded = {B, C}` ✅ (correctly subtracts)
3. User locks app A back → `blockRewardApps([A])` → `currentlyShielded = {A}` ❌ (REPLACES, should add)
4. Result: `managedSettingsStore.shield.applications = {A}` → Only A is shielded, B and C are now accessible!

**Fix Applied:**
Changed assignment to formUnion operation:

**Location:** `ScreenTimeService.swift:1060`
``swift
// BF-2 FIX: Change from assignment to formUnion to properly add tokens to existing set
// Previously: currentlyShielded = tokens (which replaced the entire set)
// Now: currentlyShielded.formUnion(tokens) (which adds tokens to existing set)
currentlyShielded.formUnion(tokens)
managedSettingsStore.shield.applications = currentlyShielded
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Apps A, B, C shielded → `{A, B, C}`
- ✅ Unlock A → `{B, C}`
- ✅ Lock A back → `{A, B, C}` (all properly shielded again)

---

## ✅ POINT CALCULATION BUG FIXED & FORMULAS CORRECTED

**Date:** 2025-10-25

**Critical Bug Discovered:** Consumed points were being returned to the available pool instead of being permanently spent. This caused available points to INCREASE when reward apps were used.

**Root Cause:** The formula was missing consumed points tracking. When `reservedPoints` decreased due to consumption, it reduced the total reserved amount, which incorrectly increased available points.

### CORRECTED Formula 1: Available Points
**Location:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift:78-93`
```
Available Points = Total Earned - Total Reserved - Total Consumed
```

**Implementation:**
- Total Earned = Sum of all learning app usage × their points/min
- Total Reserved = Sum of all `reservedPoints` from unlocked reward apps
- Total Consumed = Sum of all points spent using reward apps (NEW!)
- Available = max(0, Total Earned - Total Reserved - Total Consumed)

**Debug Output:**
- Shows Total Earned, Total Reserved, and Available on each calculation

### Formula 2: Reserved Points (Per Unlocked App)
**Location:** `UnlockedRewardApp.reservedPoints` in `AppUsage.swift:17`
```
Reserved Points = Initial Redeemed Points - Consumed Points
```

**Implementation:**
- **On Unlock:** `reservedPoints` = minutes × pointsPerMinute (e.g., 15 min × 5 pts/min = 75)
- **During Use:** `reservedPoints` -= usageMinutes × pointsPerMinute
- **Auto-lock:** When `reservedPoints` reaches 0

**Debug Output:**
- Shows each unlocked app's remaining reserved points

### Formula 3: Total Reserved Points
**Location:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift:91-104`
```
Total Reserved = Sum of (Redeemed - Consumed) for all unlocked apps
```

**Implementation:**
- Sums `reservedPoints` from all apps in `unlockedRewardApps` dictionary
- Each app's `reservedPoints` already represents (Redeemed - Consumed)

### Enhanced Debug Logging Added:
1. **💰 AVAILABLE POINTS** - Total Earned, Total Reserved, Available
2. **🔒 RESERVED POINTS** - Each unlocked app's remaining points
3. **✅ UNLOCKED** - Redemption calculation, point allocation
4. **🔒 LOCKED** - Points being returned, new totals
5. **💳 CONSUMING POINTS** - Usage time, consumption calc, before/after

### Example Scenario (CORRECTED):
```
Start: Earned=375, Reserved=0, Consumed=0
  → Available = 375 - 0 - 0 = 375 ✓

Unlock (redeem 75 points): Earned=375, Reserved=75, Consumed=0
  → Available = 375 - 75 - 0 = 300 ✓

Use 5 points: Earned=375, Reserved=70, Consumed=5
  → Available = 375 - 70 - 5 = 300 ✓ (STAYS 300!)

Use another 5 points: Earned=375, Reserved=65, Consumed=10
  → Available = 375 - 65 - 10 = 300 ✓ (STILL 300!)

Lock (return 65 unused): Earned=375, Reserved=0, Consumed=10
  → Available = 375 - 0 - 10 = 365 ✓ (65 points returned)
```

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `@Published var totalConsumedPoints: Int = 0` to track spent points
2. Updated `availableLearningPoints` to subtract `totalConsumedPoints`
3. Updated `consumeReservedPoints()` to increment `totalConsumedPoints`
4. Added persistence for `totalConsumedPoints` in `persistUnlockedApps()`
5. Added loading for `totalConsumedPoints` in `loadUnlockedApps()`

**Testing Notes:**
When testing on device, the logs will now clearly show:
- How many points were redeemed when unlocking
- How many points are consumed during usage (and total consumed)
- How many points are returned when locking
- Running totals for Available, Reserved, AND Consumed points
- **Available should remain constant while using a reward app**

## ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Background Counting Issue

**Discovered:** 2025-10-25
**Fixed:** 2025-10-26
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED

### The Issue:
Usage time is being counted for reward apps that are **NOT even visible on screen**. User switches to a different app, yet the reward app continues accumulating usage time.

### Root Cause:
**File:** `ScreenTimeService.swift`, Lines 904-925

The monitoring restart timer calls `startMonitoring()` WITHOUT first calling `stopMonitoring()`. This causes:
- Accumulated foreground time to trigger events even when app is now in background
- Spurious events to fire during monitoring restarts
- False usage counting

### The Bug:
``swift
// Lines 904-925: Monitoring restart timer
monitoringRestartTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: restartInterval, repeats: true) {
    do {
        try self.scheduleActivity()  // ❌ BUG: Missing stopMonitoring() first!
    }
}
```

### Why It's Wrong:
When `startMonitoring()` is called on an already-active session:
- DeviceActivity may flush accumulated events
- Events can fire for apps not currently in foreground
- Background apps incorrectly trigger usage recording

### The Fix:
Add `stopMonitoring()` before `startMonitoring()` to clear accumulated state:

``swift
// Stop monitoring first to clear accumulated state
self.deviceActivityCenter.stopMonitoring([self.activityName])

// Then restart fresh
do {
    try self.scheduleActivity()
}
```

### Impact:
- ✅ Prevents false counting when app is in background
- ✅ Ensures only foreground time is counted
- ⚠️ Partial intervals (< 1 min) will be lost on restart (acceptable trade-off)

## 🆕 Dev Tasking — Challenges & Non‑App Rewards (Draft Plan)

This section defines concrete, incremental tasks to implement gamified Challenges and parent‑defined Non‑App Rewards. Keep scope tight and integrate with current points and unlocking model.

### CH-1: Data Models (Models/)
- Add `Models/Challenge.swift`:
  - `struct Challenge: Codable, Identifiable { id, title, metric, target, period, startAt, endAt, repeats, status, reward }`
  - `enum ChallengeMetric { case learningMinutes, earnedPoints, streakDays(minPerDay:Int) }`
  - `enum ChallengePeriod { case daily, weekly, monthly, custom(DateInterval) }`
  - `enum ChallengeStatus { case active, completed(Date), expired(Date) }`
  - `enum ChallengeReward { case bonusPoints(Int), extraTimeMinutes(Int) }`
- Add `Models/CustomReward.swift`:
  - `struct CustomReward: Codable, Identifiable { id, title, description, emoji, costPoints, availableFrom, expiresAt, requiresApproval }`
  - `struct Redemption: Codable, Identifiable { id, type, rewardID, costPoints, createdAt, status }` with `enum RedemptionStatus { pending, approved, rejected, completed }` and `enum RedemptionType { customReward, extraTimeVoucher }`
- Add `Models/BonusVoucher.swift` (optional, if modeling extra time separately):
  - `struct BonusTimeVoucher: Codable, Identifiable { id, minutes, createdAt, expiresAt?, status }`

Acceptance:
- Models compile, Codable round‑trip works, and basic initializers exist.

### CH-2: Persistence (Services/)
- Create `Services/GamificationPersistence.swift` handling App Group storage for challenges, rewards, vouchers, and redemptions.
  - Functions: `saveChallenges([Challenge])`, `loadChallenges()`, `saveRewards([CustomReward])`, `loadRewards()`, `appendRedemption(_:)`, `saveVouchers([BonusTimeVoucher])`, `loadVouchers()`.
- Use existing app group identifier `group.com.screentimerewards.shared`.

Acceptance:
- Data persists across app restarts; simple migration path (versioned keys) is documented.

### CH-3: Challenge Engine (Services/)
- Add `Services/ChallengeService.swift` to compute progress and detect completion:
  - Subscribes to `ScreenTimeService.usageDidChangeNotification`.
  - Public API:
    - `func progress(for challenge: Challenge, using usage: [AppUsage]) -> (current: Int, target: Int)`
    - `func evaluateAllChallenges()` → issues `ChallengeAward` when newly completed (ensures idempotency per period).
    - `var onChallengesUpdated: PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>` for UI refresh.
  - Use `AppUsage.sessions` to aggregate minutes/points inside the active period window; handle day/week/month boundaries and timezones.
- On completion: emit `ChallengeAward { challengeID, issuedAt, reward }` and persist via `GamificationPersistence`.

Acceptance:
- Deterministic progress for daily/weekly/monthly; no double awards on re‑evaluation; handles overlapping challenges.

### CH-4: Bonus Handling Integration (ViewModels/)
- Extend `AppUsageViewModel` with:
  - `@Published var bonusPoints: Int` (persisted via App Group) and include in available points calculation: `available = (earned + bonusPoints) - reserved - consumed`.
  - Method: `func applyChallengeAward(_ award: ChallengeReward)`:
    - `.bonusPoints(x)`: increment `bonusPoints` and persist.
    - `.extraTimeMinutes(m)`: create/add `BonusTimeVoucher(minutes:m)` to persistence.
- Add method `func redeemBonusTime(_ voucherID: UUID, for token: ApplicationToken, minutes: Int)`:
  - Validate minutes ≤ voucher balance; convert to reserved points `minutes * pointsPerMinute(token)` and call existing unlock path; reduce voucher minutes; mark voucher completed when zero.

Acceptance:
- Available points reflect `bonusPoints`; vouchers convert to reserved points correctly across different `pointsPerMinute` apps.

### CH-5: Non‑App Rewards Integration (ViewModels/)
- Extend `AppUsageViewModel` with:
  - `@Published var customRewards: [CustomReward]`
  - `func redeemCustomReward(_ rewardID: UUID)`:
    - Ensure `availableLearningPoints ≥ cost`.
    - Increment `totalConsumedPoints` by `cost` (reuse existing consumed ledger).
    - Persist a `Redemption` record with status: `.completed` or `.pending` if approval required.

Acceptance:
- Redemption reduces available points immediately; records appear in history; approval flag respected (pending path stub acceptable in first pass).

### CH-6: Parent UI (Views/)
- Add `Views/ParentChallengesView.swift` to create/edit/delete challenges.
- Add `Views/CustomRewardsAdminView.swift` to manage non‑app rewards and view redemption history.
- Navigation: from Settings or a new “Gamification” section.

Acceptance:
- Can add a daily learning‑minutes challenge and a custom reward; lists update and persist; basic validation (non‑empty title, positive target/cost).

### CH-7: Child Mode UI (Views/)
- Add `Views/ChildModeView.swift`:
  - Displays available points, active challenges with progress, available custom rewards (sorted by affordability), and voucher balances.
  - Actions: redeem custom reward; redeem voucher as extra time for a chosen app (flow selects app from reward category list).
- Gate exit with parent PIN if Parental Controls are enabled (reuse planned PIN from roadmap; for now, a simple prompt can be stubbed behind a flag).

Acceptance:
- Child can see progress and redeem; redemption updates balances immediately and survives relaunch.

### CH-8: Notifications (Optional for v1)
- Local notifications when a challenge is completed; deep‑link to Child Mode to redeem.

Acceptance:
- Completing a challenge triggers one notification; tapping opens the app to the relevant screen.

### CH-9: Minimal Tests (Optional, lightweight)
- Model round‑trip (Codable) tests for `Challenge`, `CustomReward`, `BonusTimeVoucher`.
- Challenge engine progress tests for daily and weekly windows with synthetic sessions.

Acceptance:
- Tests compile and pass locally; skip if test infra isn’t ready.

---

Notes:
- Keep the first slice minimal: a single daily challenge metric (learning minutes) and basic custom rewards without approval flow is acceptable; iterate next.
- Align data keys with existing App Group identifiers; document any migrations.
