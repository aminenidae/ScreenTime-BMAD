## üéØ Current Sprint Goal

**Fix the Set reordering bug that shuffles app data when adding new apps to the selection.**

---

## üìä Current State Analysis - UPDATED 2025-10-20

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ **Token-based persistence** - Data survives app restarts perfectly
2. ‚úÖ **Background tracking** - Usage tracked even when app is closed
3. ‚úÖ **Data restoration** - All data correctly restored after app restart
4. ‚úÖ **Monitoring auto-restart** - DeviceActivity monitoring works across sessions
5. ‚úÖ **Token mapping stability** - UUIDs correctly assigned and preserved

### Critical Bug Identified üî¥
**THE SET REORDERING BUG DURING APP ADDITION**

**Symptom:** When adding a new app to existing selection, the data shuffles between existing apps in the UI.

**Recovery:** Data corrects itself after app restart (proves persistence is working).

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Background tracking: PASS - Usage tracked while app closed
- ‚úÖ Data persistence: PASS - Data survives restarts
- ‚úÖ Multi-restart stability: PASS - Data stable across multiple restarts
- üî¥ Add new app: FAIL - Data shuffles between existing apps
- ‚úÖ Restart after add: PASS - Data corrects itself

### Evidence
- **Log 1 (Initial):** `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.20_12-59-27--0500.xcresult`
- **Log 3 (Shuffle):** `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.20_13-08-04--0500.xcresult`
- **Log 4 (Recovery):** `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.20_13-09-06--0500.xcresult`
- **Pattern:** Set reorders when 3rd app added, causing position-based mismatch

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis - UPDATED 2025-10-20

### The Set Reordering Problem

**What Happens:**
```
User adds new app to selection
    ‚Üì
FamilyActivitySelection.applications Set gets modified
    ‚Üì
Swift Set reorders internally (non-deterministic behavior)
    ‚Üì
Set iteration order changes: [App A, App B] ‚Üí [App B, App A, App C]
    ‚Üì
UI displays apps based on iteration order ("Unknown App 0", "Unknown App 1")
    ‚Üì
MISMATCH: What was "App 0" is now "App 1" in iteration order
    ‚Üì
User sees data shuffle between apps
```

### Log Evidence

**Initial Setup (Log 1):**
- Position 0: Logical ID `A075CBFA` (hash `8a82d44`), 10 pts/min
- Position 1: Logical ID `21652C14` (hash `0dfa4c1`), 5 pts/min

**After Adding 3rd App (Log 3 - SHUFFLE OCCURRED):**
- Position 0: Logical ID `21652C14` (hash `0dfa4c1`) ‚Üê **SWAPPED**
- Position 1: Logical ID `A075CBFA` (hash `8a82d44`) ‚Üê **SWAPPED**
- Position 2: Logical ID `62E1E064` (hash `bc2cc8f`) ‚Üê NEW

**After Restart (Log 4 - DATA CORRECT):**
- Position 0: Logical ID `62E1E064`, 0s, 0pts ‚Üê New app
- Position 1: Logical ID `A075CBFA`, 240s, 40pts ‚Üê **CORRECT DATA**
- Position 2: Logical ID `21652C14`, 180s, 15pts ‚Üê **CORRECT DATA**

**Conclusion:** Token-based persistence IS working (restart proves it). The issue is UI displaying apps based on Set iteration order instead of stable identifiers.

### Why Restart Fixes It

When the app restarts:
1. Data loaded from persistent storage using token hashes ‚úÖ
2. Set reorders again (different random order)
3. But the token-based lookup correctly retrieves each app's data ‚úÖ
4. UI displays correct data because it's using the fresh iteration order

**The Real Problem:** UI relies on iteration order consistency, but Set doesn't guarantee this when modified.

## üìã DEVELOPER TASKS - UPDATED 2025-10-20

### Task 6: Sort the Applications Set Before Iteration
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**File:** `ScreenTimeService.swift`

**Problem:** Swift Set iteration order is non-deterministic. When the Set is modified (adding/removing apps), the iteration order changes unpredictably.

**Solution:** Convert the Set to a sorted array before iterating to ensure consistent ordering.

**Implementation Required:**
In `configureMonitoring()` method, before iterating through applications, sort them by token hash:

```swift
// BEFORE (current):
for (index, application) in familySelection.applications.enumerated() {
    // Processing...
}

// AFTER (fix):
let sortedApplications = familySelection.applications.sorted { app1, app2 in
    guard let token1 = app1.token, let token2 = app2.token else { return false }
    let hash1 = usagePersistence.getTokenArchiveHash(for: token1)
    let hash2 = usagePersistence.getTokenArchiveHash(for: token2)
    return hash1 < hash2
}

for (index, application) in sortedApplications.enumerated() {
    // Processing...
}
```

**Files to Update:**
- `ScreenTimeService.swift` - `configureMonitoring()` method
- Any other method that iterates through `familySelection.applications`

**Deliverable:** Code changes that ensure consistent iteration order

---

### Task 7: Apply Same Sort in ViewModel
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**File:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

**Problem:** ViewModel also iterates through applications Set. Must use same sorting to match ScreenTimeService.

**Implementation Required:**
Apply the same sorting in `getUsageTimes()` and any other method that iterates through applications:

```swift
// BEFORE (current):
for (index, application) in familySelection.applications.enumerated() {
    // ...
}

// AFTER (fix):
let sortedApplications = familySelection.applications.sorted { app1, app2 in
    guard let token1 = app1.token, let token2 = app2.token else { return false }
    return token1.hashValue < token2.hashValue  // Simple hash-based sort
}

for (index, application) in sortedApplications.enumerated() {
    // ...
}
```

**Note:** Use token.hashValue for sorting if getTokenArchiveHash() is not accessible in ViewModel.

**Deliverable:** Code changes ensuring ViewModel uses same iteration order

---

### Task 8: Consistent Sorting Across All Set Iterations
**Priority:** HIGH
**Files:** All files that iterate through `familySelection.applications`

**Implementation Required:**
Search codebase for ALL locations that iterate through the applications Set:

**Search Pattern:**
```
familySelection.applications.enumerated()
familySelection.applications.forEach
for application in familySelection.applications
```

**Apply sorting to each:**
- Use token hash-based sorting for consistency
- Ensure ALL iterations use the SAME sorting logic
- Consider creating a helper method to avoid code duplication

**Suggested Helper Method:**
```swift
// In ScreenTimeService or shared extension:
extension FamilyActivitySelection {
    func sortedApplications() -> [Application] {
        return self.applications.sorted { app1, app2 in
            guard let token1 = app1.token, let token2 = app2.token else { return false }
            return token1.hashValue < token2.hashValue
        }
    }
}

// Usage:
for application in familySelection.sortedApplications() {
    // Processing...
}
```

**Deliverable:** List all locations updated + code changes

---

### Task 9: Validation Testing - Set Reordering Fix
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Test Scenario A: Add New App Without Shuffle**

**Setup:**
1. Fresh install
2. Select 2 apps (News, Books)
3. Configure: News 5pts/min, Books 10pts/min
4. Use News for 2 minutes ‚Üí Should show 2m, 10pts
5. Use Books for 3 minutes ‚Üí Should show 3m, 30pts
6. **WITHOUT RESTARTING**: Add 3rd app (e.g., Stocks)
7. Check UI immediately

**Expected Result:**
- News: Still shows 2m, 10pts (NO SHUFFLE)
- Books: Still shows 3m, 30pts (NO SHUFFLE)
- Stocks: Shows 0m, 0pts (new app)

**Success Criteria:** No data shuffle when adding new app

---

**Test Scenario B: Remove App Without Shuffle**

**Setup:**
1. Have 3 apps configured with usage data
2. Remove the middle app from selection
3. Check UI immediately

**Expected Result:**
- Remaining apps retain their data
- No shuffle

**Success Criteria:** Data stable when removing apps

---

**Test Scenario C: Multiple Add/Remove Cycles**

**Setup:**
1. Start with 2 apps with data
2. Add 3rd app ‚Üí verify no shuffle
3. Add 4th app ‚Üí verify no shuffle
4. Remove 2nd app ‚Üí verify no shuffle
5. Add 5th app ‚Üí verify no shuffle

**Expected Result:**
- Apps maintain correct data through all modifications
- No shuffling at any point

**Success Criteria:** Complete stability across multiple operations

---

### Task 10: Restart Testing
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Test Scenario:** Verify data still persists correctly after sorting implementation

**Steps:**
1. Configure 3 apps with usage data
2. Restart app
3. Verify data correct
4. Use apps to accumulate more usage
5. Restart again
6. Verify data correct and cumulative

**Expected Result:**
- Data persists across restarts
- Sorting doesn't break persistence

**Success Criteria:** No regression in restart behavior

**Deliverable:** Validation report with logs and screenshots

### Tasks 1-5 Summary: Investigation Complete ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ Investigation Complete - Root Cause Identified
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Key Findings:**
```
Tasks 1-5 revealed that the architecture is sound:
‚úÖ Token-based persistence working correctly
‚úÖ NotificationCenter observers in place
‚úÖ Data flow is correct
‚úÖ Background tracking works
