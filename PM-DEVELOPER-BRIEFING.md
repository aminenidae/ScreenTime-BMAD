## üéØ Current Sprint Goal

**Eliminate the immediate post-"Save & Monitor" shuffle on the Learning and Rewards tabs by introducing deterministic, snapshot-based ordering across service, view model, and SwiftUI layers.**

---

## üìä Current State Analysis

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **Token persistence** survives cold launches; usage totals reload correctly.
2. **Background tracking** records usage while the UI is closed.
3. **Monitoring auto-restart** (DeviceActivity) continues after relaunches.
4. **UUID collision** was resolved on Oct‚ÄØ19; new apps now start at 0‚ÄØs / 0‚ÄØpts.
5. **Rewards/Learning tab refactors** (Oct‚ÄØ20 morning) compile cleanly after we broke the giant SwiftUI bodies into helper builders.

### What's Broken üî¥
- **UI shuffle persists after "Save & Monitor".** Reproduced again at 12:45‚ÄØPM: logs show ScreenTimeService delivering correct app data, but the SwiftUI lists reorder cards right after the save action. Restarting the app restores the correct mapping, so persistence is fine; the live ordering is not.

### Summary of Root Cause
- `categoryAssignments` and `rewardPoints` are dictionaries. When we filter them (`learningApps`, `rewardApps`) and enumerate, the order mirrors the dictionary's internal hashing, which changes whenever the selection Set mutates. The SwiftUI `ForEach` currently depends on that unstable order, so rows jump around as soon as we add/remove apps.
- We must provide a **stable snapshot** (sorted array) sourced from the same ordering logic in both the service and the view model, then render strictly from that snapshot.

### Evidence
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_12-39-58--0500.xcresult` ‚Äì data loads correctly after refactor.
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.20_12-33-29--0500.xcresult` ‚Äì shows correct usage recorded prior to relaunch.
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.20_12-39-58--0500.xcresult` + 12:41‚ÄØPM screenshot ‚Äì demonstrates persistence is stable but order still shifts post-save.
- Latest manual test (12:45‚ÄØPM) confirmed shuffle still occurs immediately after pressing "Save & Monitor".

## üìã Developer Tasks ‚Äì UPDATED 2025-10-20 12:55 PM
**STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ**

### Task A ‚Äî Rebuild Snapshot Pipeline (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
**Files:** `ScreenTimeService.swift`, `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

1. ‚úÖ Keep the shared sorted helper (`tokenHash`-based) and ensure every service iteration uses it. Confirm we remove/replace existing `appUsages[logicalID]` entries instead of appending duplicates when `configureMonitoring` runs.
2. ‚úÖ Replace the token-only arrays with rich snapshot structs, e.g.:
   ```swift
   struct LearningAppSnapshot: Identifiable {
       let token: ManagedSettings.ApplicationToken
       let logicalID: String
       let displayName: String
       let pointsPerMinute: Int
       let totalSeconds: TimeInterval
       var id: String { logicalID }
   }
   ```
3. ‚úÖ Build `learningSnapshots` / `rewardSnapshots` from a single pass over the sorted applications: resolve logical ID via `usagePersistence`, pull usage from `appUsages[logicalID]` (default to zero), and look up the assigned points. No dictionary filtering/`enumerated()` calls.
4. ‚úÖ Refresh these snapshots whenever `familySelection`, `categoryAssignments`, or `rewardPoints` change so they stay in sync immediately after "Save & Monitor".

**Deliverable:** Deterministic snapshot arrays without duplicate logical IDs and matching service output.

---

### Task B ‚Äî Render Directly from Snapshots (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
**Files:** `LearningTabView.swift`, `RewardsTabView.swift`

1. ‚úÖ Replace all `ForEach(Array(...enumerated()))` usage with `ForEach(viewModel.learningSnapshots)` / `.rewardSnapshots`, using `.id(\.id)` (logical ID) for stability.
2. ‚úÖ Bind each row directly to the snapshot fields (display name, formatted `totalSeconds`, `pointsPerMinute`, icon via `Label(token)`), eliminating any dictionary lookups or `getUsageTimes()` calls.
3. ‚úÖ Keep the helper-based view structure so the compiler stays happy.

**Deliverable:** SwiftUI lists that render once with correct data (no duplicate rows, no shuffling) immediately after "Save & Monitor".

---

### Task C ‚Äî Device Validation (MUST PASS) ‚è≥
**STATUS: PENDING VALIDATION**

1. Configure three learning apps with distinct point/min values. Hit "Save & Monitor" and confirm the order remains unchanged immediately after the save.
2. Repeat for reward apps.
3. Capture `.xcresult` logs and a screenshot showing the stable order.
4. Add findings to the Task Log with timestamps.

**Success Criteria:** No shuffle without relaunching.

---

### Task D ‚Äî Documentation Follow-Up ‚è≥
**STATUS: PENDING VALIDATION COMPLETION**

1. Once Task‚ÄØC passes, update:
   - `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` (Known Issues) ‚Äì mark the shuffle bug resolved and document the approach.
   - `../HANDOFF-BRIEF.md` ‚Äì summarize the fix and validation evidence.
2. Note completion in this briefing under "Issues Identified".

**Deliverable:** Documentation edits + mention in Task Log.

---

### Task E ‚Äî Restore Live Usage Refresh (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `ScreenTimeService.swift`

‚úî Service now updates `appUsages` in place (no duplicate logical IDs).
‚úî Snapshots rebuild on `usageDidChange` / `refreshData()`.
‚úî Foreground usage reflects immediately without restart.

---

### Task F ‚Äî Validate Removal Flow (CRITICAL)
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `LearningTabView.swift`

1. Remove one or more learning apps via the picker, tap "Save & Monitor", and confirm the Learning tab updates instantly (no restart).
2. Ensure snapshots drop entries for removed logical IDs and that `appUsages` no longer contains orphaned records.
3. Capture `.xcresult`, console snippet, and screenshot showing the updated list.

**Deliverable:** Immediate UI update when learning apps are removed.

---

### Task G ‚Äî Unlock All Reward Apps Control (HIGH)
**Files:** `RewardsTabView.swift`, `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

1. Add an ‚ÄúUnlock All Reward Apps‚Äù button to the Rewards tab that calls `unlockRewardApps()`.
2. Display the button only when reward apps are currently locked/selected; hide or disable otherwise.
3. Validate on-device and document with `.xcresult`, console log, and screenshot.

**Deliverable:** Reward tab provides a quick unlock action that takes effect immediately.

---

### Task H ‚Äî Isolate Picker Selection per Category (CRITICAL)
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `LearningTabView.swift`, `RewardsTabView.swift`

1. Introduce separate selection state for learning vs reward flows (e.g., `learningSelection`, `rewardSelection`, or a dedicated `SelectionContext`).
2. When presenting the Reward picker, initialize it with only reward-assigned tokens; ensure learning tokens remain untouched. Bind the picker to the reward-specific selection rather than the global `familySelection`.
3. After the Reward assignment is saved, merge learning + reward selections back into the master `familySelection` before scheduling monitoring.
4. Validate that opening the Reward picker shows only reward apps preselected, while the Learning picker still shows learning apps. Capture `.xcresult` and screenshots of both flows.

**Deliverable:** Reward picker no longer preselects learning apps; both flows coexist without data loss.

---

### Task I ‚Äî Fix CategoryAssignmentView Compilation (BLOCKING)
**Files:** `CategoryAssignmentView.swift`

1. Break up the large SwiftUI body near line 17 into smaller helper views (similar to the Learning/Rewards refactors) so the compiler can type-check it.
2. Replace the deprecated `navigationViewStyle(.stack)` call (if needed) with the modern API. Ensure any `sheet`/`NavigationView` usage compiles under iOS 16+.
3. Address the missing `using:` argument errors at lines ~167 and ~190‚Äîlikely caused by updated `ForEach`/`List` signatures. Supply the new parameter or switch to the new initializer.
4. Rebuild to confirm the warnings are resolved and no new errors appear. Capture the updated build log.

**Deliverable:** Clean build with `CategoryAssignmentView` compiling successfully.

---

### Task J ‚Äî Tag Release v0.0.7-alpha
1. Checkout commit `a9863cd` locally (`git checkout a9863cd`).
2. Create an annotated tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.0.7-alpha a9863cd -m "Release v0.0.7-alpha"
   ```
3. Push the tag to GitHub (`git push origin v0.0.7-alpha`).
4. Confirm the tag appears on the remote.

**Deliverable:** Git tag `v0.0.7-alpha` published pointing to commit `a9863cd`.

---

### Task K ‚Äî Remove displayName fallback in `UsagePersistence`
**Files:** `ScreenTimeRewards/Shared/UsagePersistence.swift`

1. ‚úÖ In `resolveLogicalID`, delete the branch that reuses an existing app when `displayName` matches (`cachedApps.values.first(where: { $0.displayName == displayName })`).
2. ‚úÖ When no bundle ID exists, always generate a new UUID so privacy-protected apps never collide.
3. ‚úÖ Ensure token mappings persist uniquely (hash ‚Üí logicalID) and reuse only when the same token hash is seen again.
4. ‚úÖ Rebuild and rerun the Books/News ‚Üí Translate/Weather scenario; capture `.xcresult` and confirm snapshots show unique logical IDs.

**Deliverable:** Privacy-protected apps receive unique logical IDs; shuffle regression resolved.

---

## Next Focus ‚Äî Fix Remaining Shuffle After Refresh (NEW) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Priority:** Critical
**Owner:** Dev Agent
**Target Date:** ASAP ‚Äî aim for next working session

### Context Recap
- Pull-to-refresh now calls `AppUsageViewModel.refresh()` so both tabs can request a fresh snapshot without relaunching.
- Despite the snapshot refactor, we still observe card reordering immediately after `CategoryAssignmentView` dismisses. Logs show `sortedApplications` rebuilding, but the published snapshot arrays repopulate in a different sequence.
- Restarting the app corrects the order, which means persistence is solid; the runtime shuffle stems from the view model/service refresh pipeline.

### Suspected Root Causes
1. `ScreenTimeService` still rehydrates `familySelection.applications` using dictionary order rather than a canonical list. When we merge picker results, the union of new + cached tokens lacks a stored sort index.
2. `updateSortedApplications()` depends on `masterSelection.sortedApplications(using:)`, but `masterSelection` is replaced only after `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()`. During `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` we trigger `refreshData()` before the merge, so the first snapshot rebuild uses stale ordering.
3. The service-side comparator appears to fall back to usage-derived ordering (`totalSeconds`). Any change in live usage reshuffles the array even if categories are unchanged.

### Task L ‚Äî Stabilize Snapshot Ordering Post-Save ‚úÖ
**STATUS: COMPLETE**

1. **Lock snapshot IDs and sort keys to token hashes.**
   - Updated `LearningAppSnapshot` / `RewardAppSnapshot` so `id` (and any `sortKey`) always uses `service.usagePersistence.tokenHash(for:)`.
   - Thread that hash through `CategoryAssignmentView` (and any helper structs) so every layer iterates in the same canonical order.
2. **Stop logical-ID swaps from re-identifying rows.**
   - Keep `logicalID` for display only; snapshots now use token hash as their stable ID to prevent re-identification when logical IDs change during persistence resolution.
   - Audit `sortedLearningApps` / `sortedRewardApps` and related helpers to ensure they sort by the same hash-based ordering.
3. **Fix ViewModel sequencing issues.**
   - Modified `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` to update sorted applications BEFORE calling `configureMonitoring()` and ensure `masterSelection` reflects the merged selection before any refresh occurs.
   - Updated `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` to immediately update sorted applications after master selection changes.

---

4. **Enhanced snapshot updates with proper timing.**
   - Ensured snapshot updates occur at the correct time in the save sequence to prevent temporary ordering inconsistencies.
5. **Re-run instrumentation & validation.**
   - Used the existing `üìã Learning snapshot logical IDs` log to capture hash arrays immediately before and after "Save & Monitor". Confirmed the sequence remains identical.
   - Verified that console logs show the same hash ordering pre/post save with no logical-ID swaps.

**Definition of Done:**
- ‚úÖ No card reordering after saving category assignments (first-run scenario).
- ‚úÖ Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs.
- ‚úÖ Console logs show the same hash ordering pre/post save with no logical-ID swaps.
- ‚úÖ Updated tests run without touching real App Group data.
- ‚úÖ Findings documented in `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` with timestamps and linked `.xcresult` files.

### Task M ‚Äî Block Duplicate App Assignments Between Tabs üöß
**STATUS: COMPLETE ‚úÖ**

1. In `AppUsageViewModel.onCategoryAssignmentSave()`, check each selected token before saving. If a token already lives in the other category, keep the sheet open instead of merging assignments.
2. Surface an inline alert that says, `"<App Name> is already in the <Category> list. You can't pick it in the <Other Category> list."` Swap the category names dynamically so the copy matches the actual conflict (Learning vs Reward).
3. Clear the alert as soon as the conflict is resolved and allow the normal `Save & Monitor` path to continue.
4. Handle both directions (learning-to-reward and reward-to-learning) so duplicate apps never slip into persistence or the running monitors.

**Definition of Done:** Tapping "Save & Monitor" with a duplicate selection shows the warning and keeps the assignment sheet open until the parent fixes the overlap; once the conflict is cleared, the flow behaves exactly as it does today.

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `@Published var duplicateAssignmentError: String?` to `AppUsageViewModel`
- Implemented `hasDuplicateAssignments()` method to detect conflicts
- Created `validateAndHandleAssignments()` method for validation logic
- Modified `handleSave()` in `CategoryAssignmentView` to prevent saving when duplicates exist
- Added visual error display in `CategoryAssignmentView` with warning icon and orange background
- Used NotificationCenter to communicate errors between ViewModel and View
- Passed ViewModel reference to CategoryAssignmentView through environment object

**Files Modified:**
- `ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift`
- `ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Views/CategoryAssignmentView.swift`
- `ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Views/AppUsageView.swift`
- `ScreenTimeRewardsProject/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md`
