## üéØ Current Sprint Goal

**Lock in the duplicate-prevention guard and polish the picker-driven sheets so category assignments stay isolated and presentation is stable from first launch.**

---

## üìä Current State Analysis

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **Duplicate guard holds on device.** Oct‚ÄØ24 validation confirms Reward flows cannot grab Learning apps and vice versa.
2. **Category sheets populate immediately** after picker dismiss; both tabs refresh without app relaunches.
3. **Monitoring + persistence pipeline stays stable** ‚Äî background restart timer, blocking, and reward point storage still function after saves.
4. **Privacy-token shuffle fix persists** ‚Äî unique logical IDs for privacy-protected apps across sessions.
5. **Refactored sheet coordination compiles cleanly** and keeps pending selections alive through the assignment flow.

### What's Broken üî¥
- **Picker presentation still flickers on first launch.** Console logs repeated `Label is already or no longer part of the view hierarchy` warnings; agreed to tackle only if a fast fix surfaces.
- **SwiftUI reports double-presentation warnings** (`Attempt to present ‚Ä¶ while a presentation is in progress`) when sheets open rapidly; tied to the same flicker behaviour.

### Summary of Root Cause (Updated)
- Presentation flow still races between the TabView host and the sheet presenter, causing transient dismissals and stale header binding.
- New selection flags keep category data accurate; remaining issues are limited to SwiftUI presentation ordering.

### Evidence
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.24_19-53-20--0500.xcresult` ‚Äî Confirms duplicate guard enforcement and correct Learning/Reward tab population after successive picker sessions.
- Console log (Oct‚ÄØ24 19:53) repeatedly reports `Label is already or no longer part of the view hierarchy` and double-presentation warnings; illustrates the remaining presentation race.
- Debug build transcripts (`Debug Reports/Build ScreenTimeRewards_2025-10-24T14-20-28.txt`, `‚Ä¶14-22-47.txt`, `‚Ä¶14-23-25.txt`) track the successful builds used for the latest validation run.

## üìã Developer Tasks ‚Äì UPDATED 2025-10-24 20:15 PM
**STATUS: ‚úÖ Guard validated ‚Äî polishing picker presentation and copy.**

### Task 0 ‚Äî Share a Single AppUsageViewModel & Feed Sheet With Current Picker Tokens (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
**Status:** Completed Oct‚ÄØ24. Shared `AppUsageViewModel` + `shouldUsePendingSelectionForSheet` keep pending picks alive until the sheet saves or cancels.

**Result:** Reward/Learning sheets now open populated immediately after the picker dismisses, category assignments persist, and guard validation succeeds across relaunches.

**Follow-up:** Continue to monitor multi-step flows while polishing the presentation order.

### Task M ‚Äî Picker Presentation Flicker (IN PROGRESS üöß, LOW PRIORITY)
**Files:** `ScreenTimeRewards/ScreenTimeRewards/ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `ScreenTimeRewards/ScreenTimeRewards/Views/LearningTabView.swift`, `ScreenTimeRewards/ScreenTimeRewards/Views/RewardsTabView.swift`

1. Gate sheet presentation until the picker dismissal completes to eliminate flicker and stop double-present warnings.
2. Ensure `TabHostingController` stays attached before presenting assignment sheets (`showAllLearningApps` / `showAllRewardApps`).
3. Only pursue if the fix proves quick; otherwise document and defer to a later sprint.
4. When addressed, capture a follow-up device run verifying clean console output.

**Deliverable:** (Timeboxed) First-open assignment sheets remain visible without auto-dismiss and console is free of presentation warnings. If not achievable quickly, leave notes for future sprint.

**New Coordination Notes (2025‚Äë10‚Äë24 19:51):**
- Oct‚ÄØ24 validation confirms the new flags keep sheets populated immediately after picker dismissal; retain them while we decide when to tackle the presentation flicker.
- Clear `pendingSelection` and the internal `shouldPresentAssignmentAfterPickerDismiss` flag whenever `showAllLearningApps()` / `showAllRewardApps()` present the sheet so tab-driven flows don't reuse stale picker payloads.
- Introduce a separate `shouldUsePendingSelectionForSheet` flag. Set it to `true` whenever the picker reports a new selection (`onPickerSelectionChange`). Only clear it after the sheet saves or cancels.
- Update `getSelectionForCategoryAssignment()` to return `pendingSelection` whenever `shouldUsePendingSelectionForSheet` is true and the pending selection contains apps. This must remain true immediately after the picker dismisses so the sheet sees the new tokens. Only fall back to `selection(for: context.category)` once the sheet finishes processing.
- After code change, verify logs show `Application entries count: N` matching the number of apps just picked, and that `Learning snapshot`/`Reward snapshot` counts align with the intended category post-save.


### Task A ‚Äî Rebuild Snapshot Pipeline (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
**Files:** `ScreenTimeService.swift`, `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

1. ‚úÖ Keep the shared sorted helper (`tokenHash`-based) and ensure every service iteration uses it. Confirm we remove/replace existing `appUsages[logicalID]` entries instead of appending duplicates when `configureMonitoring` runs.
2. ‚úÖ Replace the token-only arrays with rich snapshot structs, e.g.:
   ```swift
   struct LearningAppSnapshot: Identifiable {
       let token: ManagedSettings.ApplicationToken
       let logicalID: String
       let displayName: String
       let pointsPerMinute: Int
       let totalSeconds: TimeInterval
       var id: String { logicalID }
   }
   ```
3. ‚úÖ Build `learningSnapshots` / `rewardSnapshots` from a single pass over the sorted applications: resolve logical ID via `usagePersistence`, pull usage from `appUsages[logicalID]` (default to zero), and look up the assigned points. No dictionary filtering/`enumerated()` calls.
4. ‚úÖ Refresh these snapshots whenever `familySelection`, `categoryAssignments`, or `rewardPoints` change so they stay in sync immediately after "Save & Monitor".

**Deliverable:** Deterministic snapshot arrays without duplicate logical IDs and matching service output.

---

### Task B ‚Äî Render Directly from Snapshots (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
**Files:** `LearningTabView.swift`, `RewardsTabView.swift`

1. ‚úÖ Replace all `ForEach(Array(...enumerated()))` usage with `ForEach(viewModel.learningSnapshots)` / `.rewardSnapshots`, using `.id(\.id)` (logical ID) for stability.
2. ‚úÖ Bind each row directly to the snapshot fields (display name, formatted `totalSeconds`, `pointsPerMinute`, icon via `Label(token)`), eliminating any dictionary lookups or `getUsageTimes()` calls.
3. ‚úÖ Keep the helper-based view structure so the compiler stays happy.

**Deliverable:** SwiftUI lists that render once with correct data (no duplicate rows, no shuffling) immediately after "Save & Monitor".

---

### Task C ‚Äî Device Validation (MUST PASS) ‚è≥
**STATUS: PENDING VALIDATION**

1. Configure three learning apps with distinct point/min values. Hit "Save & Monitor" and confirm the order remains unchanged immediately after the save.
2. Repeat for reward apps.
3. Capture `.xcresult` logs and a screenshot showing the stable order.
4. Add findings to the Task Log with timestamps.

**Success Criteria:** No shuffle without relaunching.

---

### Task D ‚Äî Documentation Follow-Up ‚è≥
**STATUS: PENDING VALIDATION COMPLETION**

1. Once Task‚ÄØC passes, update:
   - `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` (Known Issues) ‚Äì mark the shuffle bug resolved and document the approach.
   - `../HANDOFF-BRIEF.md` ‚Äì summarize the fix and validation evidence.
2. Note completion in this briefing under "Issues Identified".

**Deliverable:** Documentation edits + mention in Task Log.

---

### Task E ‚Äî Restore Live Usage Refresh (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `ScreenTimeService.swift`

‚úî Service now updates `appUsages` in place (no duplicate logical IDs).
‚úî Snapshots rebuild on `usageDidChange` / `refreshData()`.
‚úî Foreground usage reflects immediately without restart.

---

### Task F ‚Äî Validate Removal Flow (CRITICAL)
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `LearningTabView.swift`

1. Remove one or more learning apps via the picker, tap "Save & Monitor", and confirm the Learning tab updates instantly (no restart).
2. Ensure snapshots drop entries for removed logical IDs and that `appUsages` no longer contains orphaned records.
3. Capture `.xcresult`, console snippet, and screenshot showing the updated list.

**Deliverable:** Immediate UI update when learning apps are removed.

---

### Task G ‚Äî Unlock All Reward Apps Control (HIGH)
**Files:** `RewardsTabView.swift`, `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

1. Add an "Unlock All Reward Apps" button to the Rewards tab that calls `unlockRewardApps()`.
2. Display the button only when reward apps are currently locked/selected; hide or disable otherwise.
3. Validate on-device and document with `.xcresult`, console log, and screenshot.

**Deliverable:** Reward tab provides a quick unlock action that takes effect immediately.

---

### Task H ‚Äî Isolate Picker Selection per Category (CRITICAL)
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `LearningTabView.swift`, `RewardsTabView.swift`

1. Introduce separate selection state for learning vs reward flows (e.g., `learningSelection`, `rewardSelection`, or a dedicated `SelectionContext`).
2. When presenting the Reward picker, initialize it with only reward-assigned tokens; ensure learning tokens remain untouched. Bind the picker to the reward-specific selection rather than the global `familySelection`.
3. After the Reward assignment is saved, merge learning + reward selections back into the master `familySelection` before scheduling monitoring.
4. Validate that opening the Reward picker shows only reward apps preselected, while the Learning picker still shows learning apps. Capture `.xcresult` and screenshots of both flows.

**Deliverable:** Reward picker no longer preselects learning apps; both flows coexist without data loss.

---

### Task I ‚Äî Fix CategoryAssignmentView Compilation (BLOCKING)
**Files:** `CategoryAssignmentView.swift`

1. Break up the large SwiftUI body near line 17 into smaller helper views (similar to the Learning/Rewards refactors) so the compiler can type-check it.
2. Replace the deprecated `navigationViewStyle(.stack)` call (if needed) with the modern API. Ensure any `sheet`/`NavigationView` usage compiles under iOS 16+.
3. Address the missing `using:` argument errors at lines ~167 and ~190‚Äîlikely caused by updated `ForEach`/`List` signatures. Supply the new parameter or switch to the new initializer.
4. Rebuild to confirm the warnings are resolved and no new errors appear. Capture the updated build log.

**Deliverable:** Clean build with `CategoryAssignmentView` compiling successfully.

---

### Task J ‚Äî Tag Release v0.0.7-alpha
1. Checkout commit `a9863cd` locally (`git checkout a9863cd`).
2. Create an annotated tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.0.7-alpha a9863cd -m "Release v0.0.7-alpha"
   ```
3. Push the tag to GitHub (`git push origin v0.0.7-alpha`).
4. Confirm the tag appears on the remote.

**Deliverable:** Git tag `v0.0.7-alpha` published pointing to commit `a9863cd`.

---

### Task K ‚Äî Remove displayName fallback in `UsagePersistence`
**Files:** `ScreenTimeRewards/Shared/UsagePersistence.swift`

1. ‚úÖ In `resolveLogicalID`, delete the branch that reuses an existing app when `displayName` matches (`cachedApps.values.first(where: { $0.displayName == displayName })`).
2. ‚úÖ When no bundle ID exists, always generate a new UUID so privacy-protected apps never collide.
3. ‚úÖ Ensure token mappings persist uniquely (hash ‚Üí logicalID) and reuse only when the same token hash is seen again.
4. ‚úÖ Rebuild and rerun the Books/News ‚Üí Translate/Weather scenario; capture `.xcresult` and confirm snapshots show unique logical IDs.

**Deliverable:** Privacy-protected apps receive unique logical IDs; shuffle regression resolved.

---

## Next Focus ‚Äî Fix Remaining Shuffle After Refresh (NEW) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Priority:** Critical
**Owner:** Dev Agent
**Target Date:** ASAP ‚Äî aim for next working session

### Context Recap
- Pull-to-refresh now calls `AppUsageViewModel.refresh()` so both tabs can request a fresh snapshot without relaunching.
- Despite the snapshot refactor, we still observe card reordering immediately after `CategoryAssignmentView` dismisses. Logs show `sortedApplications` rebuilding, but the published snapshot arrays repopulate in a different sequence.
- Restarting the app corrects the order, which means persistence is solid; the runtime shuffle stems from the view model/service refresh pipeline.

### Suspected Root Causes
1. `ScreenTimeService` still rehydrates `familySelection.applications` using dictionary order rather than a canonical list. When we merge picker results, the union of new + cached tokens lacks a stored sort index.
2. `updateSortedApplications()` depends on `masterSelection.sortedApplications(using:)`, but `masterSelection` is replaced only after `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()`. During `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` we trigger `refreshData()` before the merge, so the first snapshot rebuild uses stale ordering.
3. The service-side comparator appears to fall back to usage-derived ordering (`totalSeconds`). Any change in live usage reshuffles the array even if categories are unchanged.

### Task L ‚Äî Stabilize Snapshot Ordering Post-Save ‚úÖ
**STATUS: COMPLETE**

1. **Lock snapshot IDs and sort keys to token hashes.**
   - Updated `LearningAppSnapshot` / `RewardAppSnapshot` so `id` (and any `sortKey`) always uses `service.usagePersistence.tokenHash(for:)`.
   - Thread that hash through `CategoryAssignmentView` (and any helper structs) so every layer iterates in the same canonical order.
2. **Stop logical-ID swaps from re-identifying rows.**
   - Keep `logicalID` for display only; snapshots now use token hash as their stable ID to prevent re-identification when logical IDs change during persistence resolution.
   - Audit `sortedLearningApps` / `sortedRewardApps` and related helpers to ensure they sort by the same hash-based ordering.
3. **Fix ViewModel sequencing issues.**
   - Modified `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` to update sorted applications BEFORE calling `configureMonitoring()` and ensure `masterSelection` reflects the merged selection before any refresh occurs.
   - Updated `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` to immediately update sorted applications after master selection changes.

---

4. **Enhanced snapshot updates with proper timing.**
   - Ensured snapshot updates occur at the correct time in the save sequence to prevent temporary ordering inconsistencies.
5. **Re-run instrumentation & validation.**
   - Used the existing `üìã Learning snapshot logical IDs` log to capture hash arrays immediately before and after "Save & Monitor". Confirmed the sequence remains identical.
   - Verified that console logs show the same hash ordering pre/post save with no logical-ID swaps.

**Definition of Done:**
- ‚úÖ No card reordering after saving category assignments (first-run scenario).
- ‚úÖ Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs.
- ‚úÖ Console logs show the same hash ordering pre/post save with no logical-ID swaps.
- ‚úÖ Updated tests run without touching real App Group data.
- ‚úÖ Findings documented in `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` with timestamps and linked `.xcresult` files.
- ‚úÖ Duplicate assignments are properly blocked with clear user feedback.
- ‚úÖ Category assignments are preserved across sheets when editing specific categories.
- ‚úÖ All validation tests pass with proper error handling and user feedback.

### Task M ‚Äî Block Duplicate App Assignments Between Tabs üöß
**Status:** New hash-index guard coded; needs fresh device validation.

**Latest Changes (Oct‚ÄØ22 @ 22:55)**
- Replaced the single-value hash map with a hash ‚Üí `[token, category]` index so duplicates can‚Äôt overwrite each other.
- Updated `hasDuplicateAssignments()` / `validateLocalAssignments()` to detect conflicts whenever both categories appear for the same hash.
- Centralised warning copy via `makeDuplicateMessage` to ensure the PM-approved string displays once a clash is found.

**Next Validation Steps**
- Re-run Books/News scenario; expect warning to appear and save to stay blocked.
- Capture console output showing hash-index conflict plus `.xcresult` bundle.
- Provide screenshot of the warning banner if possible.

---

### Task N ‚Äî Preserve Category Assignments Across Sheets üöß
**Status:** Merge logic updated; pending confirmation that Learning list survives Reward edits.

**Latest Changes**
- Continued per-token merge path (no wholesale replacements) after validation passes.
- Debug counters now wrap the new hash-index workflow so we can see preserved counts in logs.

**Next Validation Steps**
- After Task‚ÄØM passes, relaunch immediately and confirm Learning & Reward counts match pre-save values.
- Attach `.xcresult` + console snippets showing the counts before/after save + post-relaunch.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist (All must pass)
- [ ] Duplicate assignment guard blocks conflicting saves (Task‚ÄØM).
- [ ] Learning list persists after Reward edits and relaunch (Task‚ÄØN).
- [x] Add/remove apps repeatedly without shuffle or stale data (Task‚ÄØF).
- [x] Reward picker opens with only reward apps selected (Task‚ÄØH).
- [x] Cold launch regression (ensure ordering persists across restarts).
- [x] Background accumulation regression (ensure usage still records correctly post-refactor).
- [x] No card reordering after saving category assignments (Task L).
- [x] Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs (Task L).

### Reporting Requirements
- Attach `.xcresult` logs for every validation run (shuffle, live-update, removal, and unlock scenarios).
- Provide before/after screenshots demonstrating stable ordering, live updates, and unlock behaviour.
