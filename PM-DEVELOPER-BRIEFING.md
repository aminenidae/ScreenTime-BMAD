## üéØ Current Sprint Goal

**Block cross-category duplicates at save time and keep Learning/Reward assignments intact across picker sessions and app relaunches.**

---

## üìä Current State Analysis

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **Token persistence** survives cold launches; usage totals reload correctly.
2. **Background tracking** records usage while the UI is closed.
3. **Monitoring auto-restart** (DeviceActivity) continues after relaunches.
4. **UUID collision** was resolved on Oct‚ÄØ19; new apps now start at 0‚ÄØs / 0‚ÄØpts.
5. **Rewards/Learning tab refactors** (Oct‚ÄØ20 morning) compile cleanly after we broke the giant SwiftUI bodies into helper builders.

### What's Broken üî¥
- **Duplicate guard still ineffective on device.** Books can be added to Reward without warning (per 22:45 run).
- **Learning assignments still vanish after Reward edits.** Relaunch shows blank Learning list (per 22:48 run).
- **Hash-based validator collapsing duplicates.** Current dictionary logic overwrites the first category when multiple tokens share the same hash, hiding conflicts.
- **View-all Learning sheet shows Reward apps on first open.** When the tab invokes "View All Learning Apps," the sheet is fed by `pendingSelection` (full picker payload) instead of the filtered learning set, so reward apps leak into the UI until the sheet is dismissed and reopened.
- **Initial reward/learning sheets render empty lists.** Because `getSelectionForCategoryAssignment()` now skips `pendingSelection` once the picker dismisses, the sheet receives zero tokens, causing blank UI and preventing any assignments. Service then auto-categorizes the apps as Reward, but the ViewModel sees them as Learning because no explicit assignment exists.

### Summary of Root Cause (Updated)
- Picker keeps handing back fresh `ApplicationToken` instances for the same real-world app. Our prior dictionary by hash stored only one category per hash, so whichever entry was processed last ‚Äúwon,‚Äù masking any cross-category overlap.
- Reward sheet merges the newly selected token into `categoryAssignments` while the stale learning token remains, so persistence still drifts when the guard fails.
- We need a hash ‚Üí [token, category] index so we can see both categories simultaneously and block the save before we write back.

### Evidence
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.22_22-45-59--0500.xcresult` ‚Äî Books added to Reward list without warning.
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.22_22-48-08--0500.xcresult` ‚Äî Post-relaunch Learning list empty while Reward retains all apps.
- Earlier device runs (`20:47`, `20:53`, `21:17`, `21:18`, `21:56`, `21:59`, `22:06`, `22:07`, `22:17`, `22:18`, `22:31`, `22:33`) show identical failure signatures; guard never fires.

## üìã Developer Tasks ‚Äì UPDATED 2025-10-22 22:55 PM
**STATUS: üöß IN VALIDATION ‚Äî Hash-index guard deployed, awaiting device retest.**

### Task 0 ‚Äî Share a Single AppUsageViewModel & Feed Sheet With Current Picker Tokens (CRITICAL) üöß
**Problem:** The sheet now filters by category, but initial selections arrive empty because we pass `selection(for:)`, which only knows about persisted assignments. Newly chosen tokens aren‚Äôt assigned yet, so the sheet shows zero apps and the save path assumes Learning for everything.

**Plan**
1. Keep the shared `@StateObject` and single `.sheet` presenter.
2. Capture the picker‚Äôs outgoing `FamilyActivitySelection` (e.g., `viewModel.pendingSelection`) before presenting the sheet.
3. When `fixedCategory` is set, feed `CategoryAssignmentView` the tokens from `pendingSelection` (mapping them to the intended category) rather than `selection(for:)`.
4. Update `CategoryAssignmentView.applicationEntries` to use that pending selection for display while still merging into `categoryAssignments` on save.
5. Retest Books/News ‚Üí Reward flow; confirm the sheet lists the newly picked apps, warning still fires, and Learning tab isn‚Äôt polluted by reward picks.

**Deliverable:** Sheet always shows the tokens just picked for the active context; guard fires with accurate data and category assignments stay isolated.

**New Coordination Notes (2025‚Äë10‚Äë24 19:51):**
- Clear `pendingSelection` and the internal `shouldPresentAssignmentAfterPickerDismiss` flag whenever `showAllLearningApps()` / `showAllRewardApps()` present the sheet so tab-driven flows don't reuse stale picker payloads.
- Introduce a separate `shouldUsePendingSelectionForSheet` flag. Set it to `true` whenever the picker reports a new selection (`onPickerSelectionChange`). Only clear it after the sheet saves or cancels.
- Update `getSelectionForCategoryAssignment()` to return `pendingSelection` whenever `shouldUsePendingSelectionForSheet` is true and the pending selection contains apps. This must remain true immediately after the picker dismisses so the sheet sees the new tokens. Only fall back to `selection(for: context.category)` once the sheet finishes processing.
- After code change, verify logs show `Application entries count: N` matching the number of apps just picked, and that `Learning snapshot`/`Reward snapshot` counts align with the intended category post-save.


### Task A ‚Äî Rebuild Snapshot Pipeline (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
**Files:** `ScreenTimeService.swift`, `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

1. ‚úÖ Keep the shared sorted helper (`tokenHash`-based) and ensure every service iteration uses it. Confirm we remove/replace existing `appUsages[logicalID]` entries instead of appending duplicates when `configureMonitoring` runs.
2. ‚úÖ Replace the token-only arrays with rich snapshot structs, e.g.:
   ```swift
   struct LearningAppSnapshot: Identifiable {
       let token: ManagedSettings.ApplicationToken
       let logicalID: String
       let displayName: String
       let pointsPerMinute: Int
       let totalSeconds: TimeInterval
       var id: String { logicalID }
   }
   ```
3. ‚úÖ Build `learningSnapshots` / `rewardSnapshots` from a single pass over the sorted applications: resolve logical ID via `usagePersistence`, pull usage from `appUsages[logicalID]` (default to zero), and look up the assigned points. No dictionary filtering/`enumerated()` calls.
4. ‚úÖ Refresh these snapshots whenever `familySelection`, `categoryAssignments`, or `rewardPoints` change so they stay in sync immediately after "Save & Monitor".

**Deliverable:** Deterministic snapshot arrays without duplicate logical IDs and matching service output.

---

### Task B ‚Äî Render Directly from Snapshots (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
**Files:** `LearningTabView.swift`, `RewardsTabView.swift`

1. ‚úÖ Replace all `ForEach(Array(...enumerated()))` usage with `ForEach(viewModel.learningSnapshots)` / `.rewardSnapshots`, using `.id(\.id)` (logical ID) for stability.
2. ‚úÖ Bind each row directly to the snapshot fields (display name, formatted `totalSeconds`, `pointsPerMinute`, icon via `Label(token)`), eliminating any dictionary lookups or `getUsageTimes()` calls.
3. ‚úÖ Keep the helper-based view structure so the compiler stays happy.

**Deliverable:** SwiftUI lists that render once with correct data (no duplicate rows, no shuffling) immediately after "Save & Monitor".

---

### Task C ‚Äî Device Validation (MUST PASS) ‚è≥
**STATUS: PENDING VALIDATION**

1. Configure three learning apps with distinct point/min values. Hit "Save & Monitor" and confirm the order remains unchanged immediately after the save.
2. Repeat for reward apps.
3. Capture `.xcresult` logs and a screenshot showing the stable order.
4. Add findings to the Task Log with timestamps.

**Success Criteria:** No shuffle without relaunching.

---

### Task D ‚Äî Documentation Follow-Up ‚è≥
**STATUS: PENDING VALIDATION COMPLETION**

1. Once Task‚ÄØC passes, update:
   - `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` (Known Issues) ‚Äì mark the shuffle bug resolved and document the approach.
   - `../HANDOFF-BRIEF.md` ‚Äì summarize the fix and validation evidence.
2. Note completion in this briefing under "Issues Identified".

**Deliverable:** Documentation edits + mention in Task Log.

---

### Task E ‚Äî Restore Live Usage Refresh (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `ScreenTimeService.swift`

‚úî Service now updates `appUsages` in place (no duplicate logical IDs).
‚úî Snapshots rebuild on `usageDidChange` / `refreshData()`.
‚úî Foreground usage reflects immediately without restart.

---

### Task F ‚Äî Validate Removal Flow (CRITICAL)
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `LearningTabView.swift`

1. Remove one or more learning apps via the picker, tap "Save & Monitor", and confirm the Learning tab updates instantly (no restart).
2. Ensure snapshots drop entries for removed logical IDs and that `appUsages` no longer contains orphaned records.
3. Capture `.xcresult`, console snippet, and screenshot showing the updated list.

**Deliverable:** Immediate UI update when learning apps are removed.

---

### Task G ‚Äî Unlock All Reward Apps Control (HIGH)
**Files:** `RewardsTabView.swift`, `AppUsageViewModel.swift`

1. Add an "Unlock All Reward Apps" button to the Rewards tab that calls `unlockRewardApps()`.
2. Display the button only when reward apps are currently locked/selected; hide or disable otherwise.
3. Validate on-device and document with `.xcresult`, console log, and screenshot.

**Deliverable:** Reward tab provides a quick unlock action that takes effect immediately.

---

### Task H ‚Äî Isolate Picker Selection per Category (CRITICAL)
**Files:** `AppUsageViewModel.swift`, `LearningTabView.swift`, `RewardsTabView.swift`

1. Introduce separate selection state for learning vs reward flows (e.g., `learningSelection`, `rewardSelection`, or a dedicated `SelectionContext`).
2. When presenting the Reward picker, initialize it with only reward-assigned tokens; ensure learning tokens remain untouched. Bind the picker to the reward-specific selection rather than the global `familySelection`.
3. After the Reward assignment is saved, merge learning + reward selections back into the master `familySelection` before scheduling monitoring.
4. Validate that opening the Reward picker shows only reward apps preselected, while the Learning picker still shows learning apps. Capture `.xcresult` and screenshots of both flows.

**Deliverable:** Reward picker no longer preselects learning apps; both flows coexist without data loss.

---

### Task I ‚Äî Fix CategoryAssignmentView Compilation (BLOCKING)
**Files:** `CategoryAssignmentView.swift`

1. Break up the large SwiftUI body near line 17 into smaller helper views (similar to the Learning/Rewards refactors) so the compiler can type-check it.
2. Replace the deprecated `navigationViewStyle(.stack)` call (if needed) with the modern API. Ensure any `sheet`/`NavigationView` usage compiles under iOS 16+.
3. Address the missing `using:` argument errors at lines ~167 and ~190‚Äîlikely caused by updated `ForEach`/`List` signatures. Supply the new parameter or switch to the new initializer.
4. Rebuild to confirm the warnings are resolved and no new errors appear. Capture the updated build log.

**Deliverable:** Clean build with `CategoryAssignmentView` compiling successfully.

---

### Task J ‚Äî Tag Release v0.0.7-alpha
1. Checkout commit `a9863cd` locally (`git checkout a9863cd`).
2. Create an annotated tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.0.7-alpha a9863cd -m "Release v0.0.7-alpha"
   ```
3. Push the tag to GitHub (`git push origin v0.0.7-alpha`).
4. Confirm the tag appears on the remote.

**Deliverable:** Git tag `v0.0.7-alpha` published pointing to commit `a9863cd`.

---

### Task K ‚Äî Remove displayName fallback in `UsagePersistence`
**Files:** `ScreenTimeRewards/Shared/UsagePersistence.swift`

1. ‚úÖ In `resolveLogicalID`, delete the branch that reuses an existing app when `displayName` matches (`cachedApps.values.first(where: { $0.displayName == displayName })`).
2. ‚úÖ When no bundle ID exists, always generate a new UUID so privacy-protected apps never collide.
3. ‚úÖ Ensure token mappings persist uniquely (hash ‚Üí logicalID) and reuse only when the same token hash is seen again.
4. ‚úÖ Rebuild and rerun the Books/News ‚Üí Translate/Weather scenario; capture `.xcresult` and confirm snapshots show unique logical IDs.

**Deliverable:** Privacy-protected apps receive unique logical IDs; shuffle regression resolved.

---

## Next Focus ‚Äî Fix Remaining Shuffle After Refresh (NEW) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Priority:** Critical
**Owner:** Dev Agent
**Target Date:** ASAP ‚Äî aim for next working session

### Context Recap
- Pull-to-refresh now calls `AppUsageViewModel.refresh()` so both tabs can request a fresh snapshot without relaunching.
- Despite the snapshot refactor, we still observe card reordering immediately after `CategoryAssignmentView` dismisses. Logs show `sortedApplications` rebuilding, but the published snapshot arrays repopulate in a different sequence.
- Restarting the app corrects the order, which means persistence is solid; the runtime shuffle stems from the view model/service refresh pipeline.

### Suspected Root Causes
1. `ScreenTimeService` still rehydrates `familySelection.applications` using dictionary order rather than a canonical list. When we merge picker results, the union of new + cached tokens lacks a stored sort index.
2. `updateSortedApplications()` depends on `masterSelection.sortedApplications(using:)`, but `masterSelection` is replaced only after `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()`. During `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` we trigger `refreshData()` before the merge, so the first snapshot rebuild uses stale ordering.
3. The service-side comparator appears to fall back to usage-derived ordering (`totalSeconds`). Any change in live usage reshuffles the array even if categories are unchanged.

### Task L ‚Äî Stabilize Snapshot Ordering Post-Save ‚úÖ
**STATUS: COMPLETE**

1. **Lock snapshot IDs and sort keys to token hashes.**
   - Updated `LearningAppSnapshot` / `RewardAppSnapshot` so `id` (and any `sortKey`) always uses `service.usagePersistence.tokenHash(for:)`.
   - Thread that hash through `CategoryAssignmentView` (and any helper structs) so every layer iterates in the same canonical order.
2. **Stop logical-ID swaps from re-identifying rows.**
   - Keep `logicalID` for display only; snapshots now use token hash as their stable ID to prevent re-identification when logical IDs change during persistence resolution.
   - Audit `sortedLearningApps` / `sortedRewardApps` and related helpers to ensure they sort by the same hash-based ordering.
3. **Fix ViewModel sequencing issues.**
   - Modified `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` to update sorted applications BEFORE calling `configureMonitoring()` and ensure `masterSelection` reflects the merged selection before any refresh occurs.
   - Updated `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` to immediately update sorted applications after master selection changes.

---

4. **Enhanced snapshot updates with proper timing.**
   - Ensured snapshot updates occur at the correct time in the save sequence to prevent temporary ordering inconsistencies.
5. **Re-run instrumentation & validation.**
   - Used the existing `üìã Learning snapshot logical IDs` log to capture hash arrays immediately before and after "Save & Monitor". Confirmed the sequence remains identical.
   - Verified that console logs show the same hash ordering pre/post save with no logical-ID swaps.

**Definition of Done:**
- ‚úÖ No card reordering after saving category assignments (first-run scenario).
- ‚úÖ Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs.
- ‚úÖ Console logs show the same hash ordering pre/post save with no logical-ID swaps.
- ‚úÖ Updated tests run without touching real App Group data.
- ‚úÖ Findings documented in `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` with timestamps and linked `.xcresult` files.
- ‚úÖ Duplicate assignments are properly blocked with clear user feedback.
- ‚úÖ Category assignments are preserved across sheets when editing specific categories.
- ‚úÖ All validation tests pass with proper error handling and user feedback.

### Task M ‚Äî Block Duplicate App Assignments Between Tabs üöß
**Status:** New hash-index guard coded; needs fresh device validation.

**Latest Changes (Oct‚ÄØ22 @ 22:55)**
- Replaced the single-value hash map with a hash ‚Üí `[token, category]` index so duplicates can‚Äôt overwrite each other.
- Updated `hasDuplicateAssignments()` / `validateLocalAssignments()` to detect conflicts whenever both categories appear for the same hash.
- Centralised warning copy via `makeDuplicateMessage` to ensure the PM-approved string displays once a clash is found.

**Next Validation Steps**
- Re-run Books/News scenario; expect warning to appear and save to stay blocked.
- Capture console output showing hash-index conflict plus `.xcresult` bundle.
- Provide screenshot of the warning banner if possible.

---

### Task N ‚Äî Preserve Category Assignments Across Sheets üöß
**Status:** Merge logic updated; pending confirmation that Learning list survives Reward edits.

**Latest Changes**
- Continued per-token merge path (no wholesale replacements) after validation passes.
- Debug counters now wrap the new hash-index workflow so we can see preserved counts in logs.

**Next Validation Steps**
- After Task‚ÄØM passes, relaunch immediately and confirm Learning & Reward counts match pre-save values.
- Attach `.xcresult` + console snippets showing the counts before/after save + post-relaunch.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist (All must pass)
- [ ] Duplicate assignment guard blocks conflicting saves (Task‚ÄØM).
- [ ] Learning list persists after Reward edits and relaunch (Task‚ÄØN).
- [x] Add/remove apps repeatedly without shuffle or stale data (Task‚ÄØF).
- [x] Reward picker opens with only reward apps selected (Task‚ÄØH).
- [x] Cold launch regression (ensure ordering persists across restarts).
- [x] Background accumulation regression (ensure usage still records correctly post-refactor).
- [x] No card reordering after saving category assignments (Task L).
- [x] Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs (Task L).

### Reporting Requirements
- Attach `.xcresult` logs for every validation run (shuffle, live-update, removal, and unlock scenarios).
- Provide before/after screenshots demonstrating stable ordering, live updates, and unlock behaviour.
