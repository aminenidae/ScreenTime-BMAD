# Build Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Developer:** Code Agent
**Issue:** Build failure in ScreenTimeService.swift

## Problem Description

The build was failing with the following errors:
1. `cannot find 'ScreenTimeActivityMonitor' in scope` - The `ScreenTimeActivityMonitor` class was referenced but not defined
2. `cannot assign value of type 'ScreenTimeService' to type '(any ScreenTimeActivityMonitorDelegate)?'` - The `ScreenTimeService` class was not conforming to the `ScreenTimeActivityMonitorDelegate` protocol
3. `value of type 'FamilyActivitySelection' has no member 'sortedApplications'` - Missing extension method for `FamilyActivitySelection`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added ScreenTimeActivityMonitor Class

Created the missing `ScreenTimeActivityMonitor` class that extends `DeviceActivityMonitor` and implements the necessary delegate pattern:

```swift
private final class ScreenTimeActivityMonitor: DeviceActivityMonitor {
    nonisolated(unsafe) weak var delegate: ScreenTimeActivityMonitorDelegate?

    private nonisolated func deliverToMain(_ handler: @escaping @MainActor (ScreenTimeActivityMonitorDelegate) -> Void) {
        Task { [weak self] in
            guard let self else { return }
            await MainActor.run {
                guard let delegate = self.delegate else { return }
                handler(delegate)
            }
        }
    }

    override nonisolated init() {
        super.init()
    }

    override nonisolated func intervalDidStart(for activity: DeviceActivityName) {
        deliverToMain { delegate in
            delegate.activityMonitorDidStartInterval(activity)
        }
    }

    // ... other delegate method implementations
}
```

### 2. Added ScreenTimeActivityMonitorDelegate Protocol

Defined the protocol that the `ScreenTimeService` needs to conform to:

```swift
@MainActor
private protocol ScreenTimeActivityMonitorDelegate: AnyObject {
    func activityMonitorDidStartInterval(_ activity: DeviceActivityName)
    func activityMonitorWillStartInterval(_ activity: DeviceActivityName)
    func activityMonitorDidEndInterval(_ activity: DeviceActivityName)
    func activityMonitorWillEndInterval(_ activity: DeviceActivityName)
    func activityMonitorDidReachThreshold(for event: DeviceActivityEvent.Name)
    func activityMonitorWillReachThreshold(for event: DeviceActivityEvent.Name)
}
```

### 3. Made ScreenTimeService Conform to the Protocol

Updated the class declaration to include the protocol conformance:

```swift
class ScreenTimeService: NSObject, ScreenTimeActivityMonitorDelegate
```

### 4. Implemented the Delegate Methods

Added the required delegate method implementations in an extension:

```swift
extension ScreenTimeService {
    func activityMonitorDidStartInterval(_ activity: DeviceActivityName) {
        handleIntervalDidStart(for: activity)
    }

    func activityMonitorWillStartInterval(_ activity: DeviceActivityName) {
        handleIntervalWillStartWarning(for: activity)
    }

    // ... other delegate methods
}
```

### 5. Added FamilyActivitySelection Extension

Added the missing `sortedApplications` method to `FamilyActivitySelection`:

```swift
extension FamilyActivitySelection {
    /// Returns applications sorted by token hash for consistent iteration order
    /// This fixes the Set reordering bug that causes data shuffling when adding new apps
    /// TASK L: Ensure deterministic sorting using token hash
    func sortedApplications(using usagePersistence: UsagePersistence) -> [Application] {
        return self.applications.sorted { app1, app2 in
            guard let token1 = app1.token, let token2 = app2.token else { return false }
            let hash1 = usagePersistence.tokenHash(for: token1)
            let hash2 = usagePersistence.tokenHash(for: token2)
            return hash1 < hash2
        }
    }
}
```

## Validation

The build now succeeds with the following output:
```
** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
```

## Files Modified

1. `ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` - Added the missing class definitions, protocol conformance, and extension methods

## Impact

The fix resolves all compilation errors and allows the project to build successfully. The implementation follows the existing code patterns and maintains compatibility with the rest of the application.
