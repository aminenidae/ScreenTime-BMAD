# ScreenTime Reward System - Full Stack Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the technical architecture for the ScreenTime Reward System, a native iOS/iPadOS application that implements a reward-based screen time management system for children. The system motivates educational engagement by unlocking "Reward Apps" only after children complete designated duration targets on "Learning Apps".

The architecture is designed to work exclusively within Apple's ecosystem, utilizing native frameworks and services to ensure compatibility, security, and performance while maintaining all data within Apple's privacy-compliant infrastructure.

## System Context

### User Roles

1. **Parent Users**
   - Primary administrators of the system
   - Configure learning targets and reward apps
   - Monitor children's progress through analytics
   - Manage family accounts and settings
   - Access all system features from their device

2. **Child Users**
   - End users who engage with learning and reward apps
   - View progress toward learning goals
   - Claim earned rewards
   - Have restricted access to system features

### Device Context

The application operates in a dual-device context:
- **Parent Device**: Full administrative interface with complete system access
- **Child Device**: Restricted interface for viewing progress and claiming rewards

Both devices must be part of the same Apple Family Sharing group for proper synchronization and control.

## Architectural Goals and Constraints

### Goals

1. **Seamless Apple Integration**: Deep integration with Apple's Screen Time API, Family Sharing, and CloudKit
2. **Privacy Compliance**: Full compliance with COPPA, GDPR, and Apple's App Store guidelines
3. **Performance**: Minimal battery consumption (<5%) and app size (<50MB)
4. **Reliability**: Robust synchronization across devices using Apple's native frameworks
5. **Security**: End-to-end encryption of all sensitive family data
6. **Scalability**: Support for up to 5 child profiles per family account

### Constraints

1. **Apple-Only Ecosystem**: Exclusive use of Apple's native frameworks and services
2. **No Third-Party Services**: All data storage and processing must remain within Apple's ecosystem
3. **Parental Control Limitations**: Parents control all settings from their device; children have restricted interface
4. **Device Management Restrictions**: Working within Apple's private token and device management limitations
5. **App Store Compliance**: Must meet all Apple App Store review guidelines
