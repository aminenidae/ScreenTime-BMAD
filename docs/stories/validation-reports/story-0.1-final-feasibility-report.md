# Final Technical Feasibility Report – Story 0.1

## Executive Summary
Technical feasibility testing for ScreenTime Rewards is complete. Across Phases 1–2 we validated build viability, compliance readiness, operational limits, and policy risks. With mitigations documented, the recommendation is **Go** for continued implementation, with DeviceActivityDelegate integration as the next milestone.

## Test Phases & Outcomes

| Phase | Focus | Key Evidence | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 | Build & core simulation | `phase-1-feasibility-results.md`, `story-0.1-successful-testing-report.md` | ✅ Simulated tracking, UI, and unit tests confirmed architecture viability |
| Phase 2A | Compliance & constraints | `phase-2-compliance-and-constraints.md` | ✅ Privacy/COPPA checks passed; background/battery limits understood |
| Phase 2B | Limitations & risks | `phase-2-limitations-and-risks.md` | ✅ Documented offline gaps, reward enforcement limits, policy risks with mitigations |

## Acceptance Criteria Status
1. **All plan tests executed** – Complete (see reports above).
2. **Results documented** – Complete in validation reports + this summary.
3. **Limitations identified** – Detailed in Phase 2B report.
4. **Risk assessment completed** – Policy risk table captured with likelihood/impact ratings.
5. **Go/No-Go decision** – Go, contingent on implementing mitigations.

## Consolidated Findings
- ScreenTime & FamilyControls frameworks function on physical devices; build tooling stable after raising target to iOS 15.
- Compliance checkpoints (ATT, COPPA/GDPR readiness, consent revocation) are satisfied with existing flows.
- Operational constraints: DeviceActivity pauses after 30 min offline; CloudKit sync must defer during monitoring to avoid energy spikes; rewards must rely on notifications + parental approval.
- Policy risk watchlist: entitlement changes, App Review scrutiny, evolving privacy regulations, battery usage audits.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
1. Implement DeviceActivityDelegate + persistence to capture real events (Phase 2 Task 1).
2. Add daily reminder + deferred sync backlog to cover DeviceActivity offline gaps.
3. Schedule automation for monthly token/data purge; finalize ATT copy before TestFlight.
4. Keep reward design notification-centric; avoid unsupported app locking.
5. Share this report with Product, Legal, and QA; track mitigations in the Phase 2 plan.

## Go/No-Go Decision
**Decision: GO** – Proceed with Phase 2 implementation while monitoring the documented risks and executing the recommended mitigations.
