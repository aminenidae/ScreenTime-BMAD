## Dev Notes
### Source Tree Information
This story involves reviewing documentation rather than creating application code. However, any decisions made may impact the project structure defined in the source tree documentation.

### Technology Stack Information
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Primary language: Swift 5+
- Required frameworks: ScreenTime, FamilyControls, CloudKit, AuthenticationServices
- Development environment: Xcode 12+
- The feasibility results will confirm whether this technology stack is viable

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/technical-feasibility-testing-plan.md]
- Review test execution report with detailed results
- Validate technical limitations document
- Assess implementation strategy document
- Confirm risk assessment evaluation
- Review Go/No-Go recommendation

### Previous Story Insights
This story directly follows Story 0.1 (Execute Technical Feasibility Tests). The feasibility report created in that story will be the primary input for this review process.
