# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the development environment with all necessary tools and frameworks,
**so that** I can begin implementing the application features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Xcode project is created with proper directory structure
2. SwiftUI framework is integrated and configured
3. Core Data stack is set up for local storage
4. Basic project dependencies are installed and configured
5. Initial build and run is successful on simulator

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes
### Source Tree Information
Based on the project structure defined in docs/architecture/source-tree.md, the following directory structure should be implemented:
- Root project directory with standard Xcode files (AppDelegate.swift, SceneDelegate.swift)
- Models/ directory with User, Tracking, Rewards, Analytics, and Core subdirectories
- Views/ directory with Parent, Child, Components, Modifiers, and Shared subdirectories
- ViewModels/ directory with Parent, Child, Tracking, Rewards, and Shared subdirectories
- Services/ directory for all service classes
- Utilities/, Extensions/, Protocols/, and Resources/ directories as needed

### Technology Stack Information
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Primary language: Swift 5+
- UI framework: SwiftUI
- Local storage: Core Data
- Cloud storage: CloudKit
- Authentication: AuthenticationServices (Apple Sign-In)
- Required frameworks: ScreenTime, FamilyControls, CloudKit, CoreData, SwiftUI

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use Swift 5.0+ for all code
- Follow SwiftUI best practices for view structure
- Implement proper error handling with Result types
- Use appropriate memory management (weak references in closures)
- Follow naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types)
- Maintain 4-space indentation

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Unit testing with XCTest framework
- UI testing with XCUITest framework
- Test coverage target: Above 80%
- All pull requests must pass automated tests
- Code review process required for all changes
