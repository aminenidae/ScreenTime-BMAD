  - [ ] Prepare final feasibility report with test results
  - [ ] Include Go/No-Go recommendation based on findings
  - [ ] Present findings to stakeholders for decision

## Dev Notes
### Source Tree Information
While this story doesn't involve creating the main application structure, it will require creating a separate test project to validate the feasibility of our core concepts.

### Technology Stack Information
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Primary language: Swift 5+
- Required frameworks: ScreenTime, FamilyControls, CloudKit, AuthenticationServices
- Development environment: Xcode 12+
- Testing frameworks: XCTest for unit testing
- Privacy frameworks: App Tracking Transparency, CryptoKit

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use Swift 5.0+ for all code
- Follow proper error handling with Result types
- Use appropriate memory management (weak references in closures)
- Follow naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types)
- Maintain 4-space indentation

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/technical-feasibility-testing-plan.md]
- Test execution following the 5-phase plan:
  1. Research and Setup (Week 1)
  2. Core Functionality Testing (Weeks 2-3)
  3. Compliance and Constraints Testing (Week 4)
  4. Risk Assessment and Documentation (Week 5)
- All tests must be documented with clear pass/fail criteria
- Battery impact must remain below 5% during normal operation
- Time tracking must be accurate within 5% margin of error

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

This story is focused on technical feasibility testing rather than code implementation. The story structure is well-organized with clear acceptance criteria and tasks that align with the technical feasibility testing plan. The integration with architecture and coding standards documentation is appropriate for this phase.

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring was performed as this story is focused on testing rather than implementation.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ N/A - This story is testing-focused
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows defined story structure
