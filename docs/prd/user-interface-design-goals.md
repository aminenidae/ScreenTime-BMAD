# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The application will feature a dual-interface design with a parent dashboard for management and a child-friendly interface for engagement. The parent interface will focus on configuration and monitoring with full control capabilities, while the child interface will emphasize gamification and visual progress tracking with limited interaction capabilities.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
1. Centralized parent control - all configuration and management from parent device
2. Restricted child interface - limited to viewing progress and claiming rewards
3. Real-time synchronization between parent and child devices
4. Seamless integration with existing iOS/iPadOS user experience patterns

## Core Screens and Views
1. Parent Dashboard - Main control center for setting targets, managing settings, and monitoring progress
2. Child Progress View - Visual representation of learning goals and earned rewards (view only)
3. App Selection Interface - Tools for parents to categorize apps as learning or reward
4. Parent Settings Panel - Full configuration options for family accounts and preferences
5. Child Reward Claim Interface - Simplified interface for children to claim earned rewards
6. Parent Analytics Dashboard - Detailed insights and reporting on children's app usage

## Accessibility
WCAG AA compliance for parent interface, simplified accessibility for child interface

## Branding
Clean, modern design with vibrant colors for child interface and professional appearance for parent interface

## Target Device and Platforms
iOS and iPadOS devices running version 14 or higher
