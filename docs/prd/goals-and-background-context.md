# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a reward-based screen time management system for iOS/iPadOS devices
- Motivate children to engage with educational content through positive reinforcement
- Provide parents with tools to balance learning and recreational screen time
- Seamlessly integrate with Apple's native Screen Time API
- Establish a sustainable business model through premium subscriptions

## Background Context
The ScreenTime Reward System addresses the challenge parents face in motivating children to engage with educational content on digital devices. Traditional screen time management solutions focus on restriction rather than positive reinforcement. This project leverages Apple's native Screen Time API to create a system where children earn access to entertainment apps by completing designated time targets on learning apps. The solution transforms screen time from a potential source of conflict into an incentive for educational engagement.
