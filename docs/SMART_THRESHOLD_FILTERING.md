## Problem

When `startMonitoring()` is called on `DeviceActivityCenter`, iOS fires catch-up threshold events for ALL cumulative daily usage. Previous approach: a 60-second window in the extension blocked these events, but iOS considered the thresholds "delivered." If usage was high enough (e.g., 30+ minutes across apps), all registered thresholds were consumed — monitoring died silently. The only recovery was manually opening the main app, which is impractical for a parental controls app on a child's device.

This led to 21+ fix attempts over 3 months (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026), adding increasingly complex flood detection/correction machinery: `flood_max` capture, bidirectional corrections, dual correction paths, `flood_detected` signaling, 65-second delayed restarts, foreground flood recovery, and `last_flood_correction_timestamp` suppression. Despite all this, the fundamental issue persisted: blocked catch-up events consumed thresholds, killing monitoring.

## Root Cause

Thresholds were always registered starting at minute 1 regardless of current usage. iOS always had catch-up events to fire for any accumulated usage.

## Solution

Register thresholds starting **above** current cumulative usage. No thresholds below current usage = no catch-up events = no floods = monitoring starts cleanly.

### How It Works

In `scheduleActivity()` (the only place `startMonitoring()` is called), before building the events dictionary:

1. Read each app's current daily usage from shared UserDefaults (`ext_usage_{logicalID}_today`)
2. Verify the data is from today (`ext_usage_{logicalID}_date`)
3. Compute `currentUsageMinutes = seconds / 60`
4. Filter out all threshold events where `minuteNumber <= currentUsageMinutes`
5. Pass only the remaining (above-current-usage) events to `startMonitoring()`

```
Example: App has 30 minutes of recorded usage today
- Before: Register thresholds 1-60 → iOS fires catch-up for 1-30 → all blocked → dead
- After:  Register thresholds 31-60 → iOS has nothing to catch up on → monitoring works
```

### Defense in Depth

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Smart filtering | `scheduleActivity()` in ScreenTimeService | Prevents catch-up events at registration time |
| 60s restart window | `setUsageToThreshold()` in extension | Safety net for small usage-estimate drift |
| Calibration reset | `scheduleActivity()` in ScreenTimeService | One-time clear of inflated ext_usage from previous bug |
| `activities.contains()` | `init()` crash recovery in ScreenTimeService | Skips restart if monitoring already active at OS level |
| `checkMonitoringHealth()` | Foreground check in ScreenTimeRewardsApp | Detects dead monitoring, triggers restart (safe with smart filtering) |
| `includesPastActivity: false` | `deviceActivityEvent()` on iOS 17.4+ | Apple's own catch-up prevention (additional safety) |

## What Was Removed

### Flood Machinery (all removed)

| Component | What It Did | Why Removed |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `flood_skip_count` | Counted events blocked by 60s window | No floods → no blocked events to count |
| `flood_detected` / `flood_detected_time` | Signaled main app for recovery when >10 events blocked | No floods → no signal needed |
| `flood_max_{appID}` | Captured highest threshold during flood as iOS ground truth | No floods → no ground truth to capture |
| Bidirectional flood correction | Set usage to `flood_max` value (intervalDidStart + restart-reset block) | No floods → nothing to correct |
| `last_flood_correction_timestamp` | Suppressed false flood detection during expected catch-up | No flood detection to suppress |
| `last_flood_recovery_timestamp` | 5-minute cooldown for foreground recovery | Replaced by simple health check |
| 65s delayed restart | Second restart after crash recovery to get fresh thresholds | Smart filtering makes first restart sufficient |
| `ext_lastHandledRestartTimestamp` | Prevented re-applying correction for same restart | Kept — still used for lastThreshold reset |

### UserDefaults Keys Removed

```
flood_skip_count
flood_detected
flood_detected_time
flood_max_{appID}          (per-app, dynamic key)
last_flood_correction_timestamp
last_flood_recovery_timestamp
```

### UserDefaults Keys Kept

```
monitoring_restart_timestamp    — 60s safety window
ext_lastHandledRestartTimestamp  — post-restart lastThreshold reset
tracked_app_ids                 — iteration target for resets
wasMonitoringActive             — crash recovery flag
```

### UserDefaults Keys Added

```
catchup_max_{appID}            — per-app (DEAD CODE: no longer captured, correction paths remain but never fire)
ext_usage_calibrated_v1        — one-time flag, prevents re-running calibration reset
catchup_fix_v2                 — one-time flag, clears stale catchup_max from SKIP_RESTART capture era
catchup_fix_v3                 — one-time flag, clears inflated usage from SKIP_COOLDOWN capture era
```

## What Was Kept / Simplified

### Extension Filter Chain (`setUsageToThreshold()`)

| Filter | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 60s restart window | Safety net for small drift | Silently drops catch-ups (no catchup_max capture) |
| Post-restart threshold reset | Reset `lastThreshold` to 0 for all apps | Applies pending `catchup_max` correction before resetting (dead code — no capture source) |
| 55s per-app cooldown | Same app can't fire twice in <55s | Silently drops burst events (no catchup_max capture — removed due to stale cross-midnight inflation) |
| Minimum threshold (60s) | Block sub-minute phantom events | Unchanged |
| Shielded reward app | Block events for blocked apps | Unchanged |
| Threshold progression | Same-day thresholds must increase | Unchanged |
| Catchup correction (pre-record) | Apply pending `catchup_max` before recording | Dead code — no capture source remains |

### Extension `intervalDidStart()`

- Set `monitoring_restart_timestamp`
- Apply pending `catchup_max` corrections for all tracked apps (dead code — no capture source)
- Reset `lastThreshold` to 0 for all tracked apps
- Lifecycle log + heartbeat

### Foreground Recovery

Replaced flood-gated recovery with `ScreenTimeService.checkMonitoringHealth()`:
- Checks `activities.contains(activityName)` via `DeviceActivityCenter`
- If monitoring should be active but isn't registered → restarts
- Safe because `restartMonitoring()` → `scheduleActivity()` → smart filtering → no flood

## catchup_max Burst Correction (REMOVED — Feb 2026)

### Original Problem

When iOS kills the extension process and relaunches it, all accumulated thresholds arrive in the same second. The 55s per-app cooldown blocks all but the first event per app, losing most accumulated usage (up to 15 min per burst).

### Original Solution

During SKIP_COOLDOWN, capture the highest threshold per app as `catchup_max_{appID}`. Apply upward correction at the next opportunity via 4 correction paths.

### Why It Was Removed

With `includesPastActivity: true`, iOS retains cumulative usage across midnight. After day rollover, catch-up bursts carry **yesterday's stale residual data** (e.g., 55-88 min). These bursts can arrive **40+ minutes after restart** (via extension kill/relaunch cycles), bypassing the 60s absorb window entirely. SKIP_COOLDOWN captured these stale thresholds into `catchup_max`, which was then applied as an upward correction — inflating usage by 60+ min.

This caused cascading failures: inflated learning app usage falsely met goals → reward apps unshielded → those catch-ups also captured → all apps showed 60+ min when real usage was 5-27 min.

**Fix:** Removed catchup_max capture from SKIP_COOLDOWN entirely. The 4 correction paths remain as dead code (no capture source) and can be cleaned up in a future PR.

**Trade-off:** Legitimate mid-day burst corrections are lost (10-20 min undercount possible). The sliding window self-corrects over subsequent restart cycles. For a parental controls app, undercount is safe; overcount falsely meets goals and blocks reward apps.

### 4 Correction Paths (dead code — no capture source)

| Path | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `intervalDidStart()` | Extension | Dead code |
| RESTART_THRESHOLD_RESET | Extension `setUsageToThreshold()` | Dead code |
| Before recording | Extension `setUsageToThreshold()` | Dead code |
| `readExtensionUsageData()` | Main app ScreenTimeService | Dead code |

## One-Time Calibration Reset

### Problem

The previous version's flood correction code (`flood_max` capture + bidirectional correction) inflated `ext_usage_today` values for some apps. After removing that code and adding smart filtering, these inflated values created a deadlock:

Inflated ext_usage → smart filtering skips all thresholds → no catch-up events → `catchup_max` never captures anything → no correction → ext_usage stays inflated.

Apps with 0 real usage were worst affected — they had inflated ext_usage but iOS had 0 cumulative usage, so nothing could ever fire.

### Solution

One-time reset gated by `ext_usage_calibrated_v1` flag, triggered at the top of `scheduleActivity()`:

1. Clear `ext_usage_today`, `ext_usage_date`, `usage_today` for all tracked apps
2. Reset `persistedApp.todaySeconds` to 0 in persistence
3. Set `ext_usage_calibrated_v1 = true`

After the reset, smart filtering sees 0 for all apps → registers all 60 thresholds → iOS sends catch-up events for actual cumulative usage → blocked by 60s window → `catchup_max` captures → main-app correction path applies on next foreground.

Apps with 0 real usage: no catch-ups (iOS has nothing to report) → ext_usage stays 0 → correct.

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Fresh install (no usage) | All 60 thresholds registered (currentMinutes=0), normal |
| Usage >= 60 min for an app | All thresholds filtered, no events registered (tracking complete for today) |
| Usage estimate off by 1-2 min | 60s safety window catches the overlap |
| Day change | `ext_usage_date` is yesterday → currentMinutes=0 → all 60 thresholds |
| Multiple rapid restarts | Each call reads latest usage, filters correctly |
| Extension process dies during recording | UserDefaults persists; next event reads correct state |
| Extension killed after burst delivery | First event of burst recorded (+60s); rest silently dropped. Sliding window self-corrects over subsequent restarts |
| Main app killed in background | `checkMonitoringHealth()` recovers on next foreground |
| Inflated ext_usage from previous version | Calibration reset clears on first `scheduleActivity()` call |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` | Smart threshold filtering in `scheduleActivity()`, `checkMonitoringHealth()`, catchup_max correction in `readExtensionUsageData()` (dead code), calibration resets (v1/v2/v3) in `scheduleActivity()` |
| `ScreenTimeActivityExtension/DeviceActivityMonitorExtension.swift` | `catchup_max` capture removed from SKIP_COOLDOWN; correction paths in RESTART_THRESHOLD_RESET + before-recording + `intervalDidStart()` (dead code) |
| `ScreenTimeRewardsApp.swift` | Replaced flood recovery with `checkMonitoringHealth()` call |

## Historical Context

The flood problem emerged Dec 2, 2025 (`b5b097e`) when `monitoring_restart_timestamp` was first introduced with a 10-second catch-up window. Before that (`4aac8be`, Nov 27), the extension had no restart awareness — floods existed but events leaked through and were recorded, so monitoring never died. The problem intensified when thresholds were increased from 60 to 180 (Dec 10) and then 240 (Jan 21) per app, amplifying flood size. After reverting to 60 (Jan 24), the 60-second window was added but it blocked ALL events, consuming thresholds without recording — causing the "monitoring dies after flood" symptom that persisted through 21 fix attempts.

The fundamental insight: **prevent floods at the source** (skip already-exceeded thresholds) rather than **handle floods after they occur** (block + detect + correct + recover).

### catchup_max Removal (Feb 16, 2026)

The `catchup_max` burst correction system, added alongside smart filtering, was designed to recover usage lost when iOS delivers multiple events in a single burst (only the first passes the 55s cooldown). However, with `includesPastActivity: true`, iOS retains cumulative usage across midnight. After day rollover, catch-up bursts carry yesterday's stale data. These bursts arrive via extension kill/relaunch cycles — sometimes 40+ minutes after the last restart — completely bypassing the 60s absorb window. SKIP_COOLDOWN captured these stale thresholds into `catchup_max`, inflating usage by 60+ min and falsely meeting learning goals.

The fix was to remove `catchup_max` capture entirely, accepting minor undercounting from legitimate mid-day bursts (the sliding window self-corrects over subsequent restarts). One-time `catchup_fix_v3` reset clears inflated values.
