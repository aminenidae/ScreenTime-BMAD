## Non-Functional Requirements Evaluation

### Security
**Status**: PASS
**Notes**: The story appropriately includes security compliance testing as part of the feasibility validation. Tasks specifically mention implementing and testing privacy and security compliance, including COPPA/GDPR compliance mechanisms.

### Performance
**Status**: PASS
**Notes**: Performance validation is included in the testing plan with specific criteria such as battery impact remaining below 5% and time tracking accuracy within 5% margin of error.

### Reliability
**Status**: PASS
**Notes**: The testing plan includes validation of background processing limitations and cross-device synchronization, which are key reliability factors for the system.

### Maintainability
**Status**: PASS
**Notes**: While not directly applicable to feasibility testing, the story correctly references coding standards and technical documentation that will support maintainability in the implementation phase.

### Usability
**Status**: CONCERNS
**Notes**: Usability testing is not explicitly mentioned in the feasibility testing plan. While the focus is on technical feasibility, some basic usability validation of the test implementations would be beneficial.

### Compatibility
**Status**: PASS
**Notes**: The story correctly references testing across multiple iOS versions and device types as part of the technical feasibility validation.

## Recommendations

### Immediate
- Consider adding basic usability validation to the testing plan
- Ensure all test scenarios document expected user experience outcomes

### Future
- Plan for comprehensive usability testing in later phases
- Consider accessibility testing as part of the broader test strategy

## Overall NFR Compliance
Good - The story addresses most critical NFRs for feasibility testing, with a minor gap in usability validation.
