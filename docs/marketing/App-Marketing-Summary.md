# ScreenTime Rewards - App Summary for Marketing

## What Is ScreenTime Rewards?

ScreenTime Rewards is a family app that turns screen time battles into a win-win for parents and kids. Instead of fighting over phone and tablet time, the app creates a simple deal: **kids use learning apps first, and entertainment apps unlock automatically as a reward.**

No more daily arguments. No more negotiations. Just a fair, automatic system that kids actually want to follow.

## The Problem We Solve

**Every parent knows "The Daily Battle":**

- "Just 5 more minutes!"
- "Why can't I play my game?"
- "This isn't fair!"

Parents spend 15+ minutes every day arguing about screen time. Current solutions only block and restrict — making kids feel punished. This creates stress, conflict, and a constant power struggle.

**ScreenTime Rewards flips the script.** Instead of taking things away, we help kids earn what they want. Learning becomes the key that unlocks fun.

## How It Works (In Simple Terms)

1. **Parents set up learning goals** — Choose which educational apps count (like language learning, math practice, or reading apps)

2. **Parents pick reward apps** — Select which entertainment apps kids love (games, videos, social media)

3. **Kids learn, apps unlock** — When kids hit their learning goals, reward apps unlock instantly and automatically

4. **Everyone wins** — Kids feel in control. Parents get peace of mind. No daily intervention needed.

| Feels like punishment | Feels like achievement |
| Creates conflict | Creates collaboration |
| Requires daily parent involvement | Runs automatically |
