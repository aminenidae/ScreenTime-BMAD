# ScreenTime Rewards - Implementation Progress Summary

## Current Status
✅ **STABILIZING** – Duplicate guard validated on device; remaining work focuses on picker presentation polish and Learning header copy.

### Latest Validation (Oct 24, 2025)
- ✅ Duplicate guard holds across back-to-back picker sessions; Reward flows cannot retain Learning apps.
- ✅ Learning and Reward tabs refresh instantly after save; correct apps show without relaunching.
- ✅ Removing a reward app no longer migrates it into the Learning tab (fixed in latest update).
- ✅ Re-adding a removed app now properly resets its usage/points data to zero (fixed in latest update).
- ⚠️ Initial picker presentation still flickers and logs `Label is already or no longer part of the view hierarchy` warnings.
- ✅ Learning sheet header now renders the correct copy after the latest fix.

See `PM-DEVELOPER-BRIEFING.md` Task M for the remaining polish plan.

## Technical Validation

### Privacy Compliance
- ✅ Uses ApplicationToken as primary identifier
- ✅ No dependency on bundle identifiers or display names
- ✅ FamilyControls authorization before picker access
- ✅ App Group storage for extension communication

### Functionality Testing
- ✅ FamilyActivityPicker returns tokens successfully
- ✅ Label(token) displays real app names/icons
- ✅ Category assignment works correctly
- ✅ Reward points are calculated properly
- ✅ DeviceActivity events fire when thresholds reached
- ✅ Usage data appears in app after events
- ✅ Category totals update correctly
- ✅ Data persists across app restarts
- ✅ Category adjustment workflow functions
- ✅ App removal workflow functions correctly

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Category Simplification
- **Decision:** Reduced from Apple's 7+ categories to just 2 (Learning/Reward)
- **Rationale:** Simpler for users, better aligned with app's reward concept
- **Impact:** Improved UX, reduced complexity

### 2. Reward Points Calculation
- **Decision:** Changed from category multipliers to user-assigned points × time
- **Rationale:** More intuitive and flexible for users
- **Impact:** Direct correlation between assigned points and earned rewards

### 3. Category Adjustment Workflow
- **Decision:** Implemented smart reopening that preserves existing assignments
- **Rationale:** Users need to adjust after initial setup
- **Impact:** Seamless user experience for ongoing management

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Apple's Privacy Design
- FamilyActivityPicker intentionally withholds app identifiers
- ApplicationToken is the only reliable identifier
- Must request authorization before opening picker
- Label(token) is the proper way to display app names

### 2. Data Persistence Challenges
- UserDefaults limitations with complex keys
- Need for token hash-based storage approach
- Importance of App Group configuration
- Proper cleanup of orphaned data

### 3. Extension Communication
- Darwin notifications carry no payload
- App Group storage required for data exchange
- Timing considerations for notification handling

## Code Quality Achievements

### 1. Architecture
- Clean MVVM implementation
- Proper separation of concerns
- Reactive programming with Combine
- Dependency injection for testability

### 2. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of nil values
- Clear error messages for users
- Robust authorization flow
- Proper state management

### 3. Documentation
- Comprehensive technical documentation
- Clear code comments
- Inline explanations of complex logic
