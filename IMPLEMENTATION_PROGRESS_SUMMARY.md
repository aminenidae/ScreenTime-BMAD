- ✅ Category totals update correctly
- ✅ Data persists across app restarts
- ✅ Category adjustment workflow functions
- ✅ App removal workflow functions correctly
- ✅ **Selection persistence works with JSONEncoder**

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Category Simplification
- **Decision:** Reduced from Apple's 7+ categories to just 2 (Learning/Reward)
- **Rationale:** Simpler for users, better aligned with app's reward concept
- **Impact:** Improved UX, reduced complexity

### 2. Reward Points Calculation
- **Decision:** Changed from category multipliers to user-assigned points × time
- **Rationale:** More intuitive and flexible for users
- **Impact:** Direct correlation between assigned points and earned rewards

### 3. Category Adjustment Workflow
- **Decision:** Implemented smart reopening that preserves existing assignments
- **Rationale:** Users need to adjust after initial setup
- **Impact:** Seamless user experience for ongoing management

### 4. Category Selection Solution ⭐ NEW
- **Decision:** Use Apple's official `includeEntireCategory: true` flag
- **Rationale:** Official Apple solution (iOS 15.2+) for category token expansion
- **Impact:** Clean, supported solution that automatically expands categories to app tokens
- **Previous Approach:** Explored "master selection seeding" workaround before discovering official solution
- **Key Requirement:** Must use JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder (PropertyListEncoder has bug with this flag)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Apple's Privacy Design
- FamilyActivityPicker intentionally withholds app identifiers
- ApplicationToken is the only reliable identifier
- Must request authorization before opening picker
- Label(token) is the proper way to display app names

### 2. Data Persistence Challenges
- UserDefaults limitations with complex keys
- Need for token hash-based storage approach
- Importance of App Group configuration
- Proper cleanup of orphaned data
- **CRITICAL:** Must use JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder for FamilyActivitySelection (PropertyListEncoder drops `includeEntireCategory` flag)

### 3. Extension Communication
- Darwin notifications carry no payload
- App Group storage required for data exchange
- Timing considerations for notification handling

### 4. Category Token Handling ⭐ RESOLVED
- **Solution:** Use `FamilyActivitySelection(includeEntireCategory: true)`
- **Available Since:** iOS 15.2+
- **Behavior:** Automatically expands category selections to include all individual app tokens
- **Persistence:** Requires JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder
- **Documentation:** Not well-documented initially, discovered through investigation
- **Community Resources:** Stack Overflow, Apple forums, and investigation PDFs were valuable

### 5. Development Process Insights
- Always research official Apple solutions before building workarounds
- Developer community resources are invaluable
- Experimental prototyping helps validate problems even if final solution differs
- Official documentation may not cover all API features comprehensively

## Code Quality Achievements

### 1. Architecture
- Clean MVVM implementation
- Proper separation of concerns
- Reactive programming with Combine
- Dependency injection for testability

### 2. Error Handling
