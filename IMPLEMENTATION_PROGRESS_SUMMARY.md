## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Category Simplification
- **Decision:** Reduced from Apple's 7+ categories to just 2 (Learning/Reward)
- **Rationale:** Simpler for users, better aligned with app's reward concept
- **Impact:** Improved UX, reduced complexity

### 2. Reward Points Calculation
- **Decision:** Changed from category multipliers to user-assigned points × time
- **Rationale:** More intuitive and flexible for users
- **Impact:** Direct correlation between assigned points and earned rewards

### 3. Category Adjustment Workflow
- **Decision:** Implemented smart reopening that preserves existing assignments
- **Rationale:** Users need to adjust after initial setup
- **Impact:** Seamless user experience for ongoing management

### 4. Category Selection Solution ⭐ NEW
- **Decision:** Use Apple's official `includeEntireCategory: true` flag
- **Rationale:** Official Apple solution (iOS 15.2+) for category token expansion
- **Impact:** Clean, supported solution that automatically expands categories to app tokens
- **Previous Approach:** Explored "master selection seeding" workaround before discovering official solution
- **Key Requirement:** Must use JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder (PropertyListEncoder has bug with this flag)

## Critical Bug Fixes (Oct 26, 2025)

### 1. Points Calculation Architecture ⭐ CRITICAL FIX
- **Problem:** `earnedRewardPoints` was a computed property that retroactively recalculated all historical usage with the current rate
- **Impact:** Changing points/minute from 75 to 230 recalculated past usage, showing incorrect totals
- **Solution:** Changed to stored property, incrementally adding points in `recordUsage()` method
- **Files Modified:**
  - `Models/AppUsage.swift` - Changed earnedRewardPoints from computed to stored property
  - Added incremental calculation in `recordUsage()` method
  - Updated all initializers to set earnedRewardPoints
- **Benefit:** Points are now "locked in" when earned - rate changes only affect future usage

### 2. Configuration Reload Bug ⭐ CRITICAL FIX
- **Problem:** `configureMonitoring()` saved new rate to disk but kept old rate in memory
- **Impact:** Next usage event calculated points using old rate despite UI showing new rate
- **Solution:** Always reload AppUsage from persistence after configuration changes
- **Files Modified:**
  - `Services/ScreenTimeService.swift:612-617` - Added forced reload from persistence
- **Benefit:** Configuration changes take effect immediately

### 3. View Display Bug ⭐ CRITICAL FIX
- **Problem:** App cards recalculated points: `totalSeconds / 60 * currentRate` instead of showing actual earned
- **Impact:** App cards showed different points than "Total Points Earned"
- **Solution:** Added `earnedPoints` field to snapshots, display stored value
- **Files Modified:**
  - `ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` - Added earnedPoints to snapshot structs
  - `Views/LearningTabView.swift` - Display snapshot.earnedPoints instead of calculating
- **Benefit:** Consistent points display across all UI elements

### 4. Token Hash Stability Bug ⭐ CRITICAL FIX
- **Problem:** Used unstable `token.hashValue` which changes on each app launch
- **Impact:** Unlocked reward apps appeared locked after app relaunch (but remained functionally unlocked)
- **Solution:** Switched to stable SHA-256 `tokenHash` for token identification
- **Files Modified:**
  - `Models/AppUsage.swift` - UnlockedRewardApp initializers now accept tokenHash parameter
  - `ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` - Use stable tokenHash for matching
- **Benefit:** Unlocked apps persist correctly across app restarts

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Apple's Privacy Design
- FamilyActivityPicker intentionally withholds app identifiers
- ApplicationToken is the only reliable identifier
- Must request authorization before opening picker
- Label(token) is the proper way to display app names

### 2. Data Persistence Challenges
- UserDefaults limitations with complex keys
- Need for token hash-based storage approach
- Importance of App Group configuration
- Proper cleanup of orphaned data
- **CRITICAL:** Must use JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder for FamilyActivitySelection (PropertyListEncoder drops `includeEntireCategory` flag)

### 3. Extension Communication
- Darwin notifications carry no payload
- App Group storage required for data exchange
- Timing considerations for notification handling

### 4. Category Token Handling ⭐ RESOLVED
- **Solution:** Use `FamilyActivitySelection(includeEntireCategory: true)`
- **Available Since:** iOS 15.2+
- **Behavior:** Automatically expands category selections to include all individual app tokens
- **Persistence:** Requires JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder
- **Documentation:** Not well-documented initially, discovered through investigation
- **Community Resources:** Stack Overflow, Apple forums, and investigation PDFs were valuable

### 5. Development Process Insights
- Always research official Apple solutions before building workarounds
- Developer community resources are invaluable
- Experimental prototyping helps validate problems even if final solution differs
- Official documentation may not cover all API features comprehensively

### 6. Points Calculation Best Practices ⭐ NEW (Oct 26)
- **Never use computed properties for accumulating values** - Use stored properties
- **Incremental tracking is better than recalculation** - Add to existing value, don't recalculate from total
- **Reload from persistence after configuration changes** - Don't assume in-memory state is current
- **Use stable hashes for token identification** - SHA-256 instead of Swift's unstable hashValue
- **Display stored values, not calculated values** - Avoid recalculation in views
