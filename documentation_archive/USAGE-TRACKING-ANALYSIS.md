# Usage Tracking Analysis
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Issue:** App counting usage time even when reward app is open but not actively being used

---

## üîç Current Implementation

### How Usage Tracking Works

**Location:** `ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift`

1. **Threshold Configuration** (Line 83):
   ```swift
   private let defaultThreshold = DateComponents(minute: 1)
   ```
   - Default threshold is **1 minute**
   - This means every 1 minute of "usage" triggers an event

2. **Event Creation** (Lines 570-586):
   ```swift
   let eventName = DeviceActivityEvent.Name("usage.app.\(eventIndex)")
   result[eventName] = MonitoredEvent(
       name: eventName,
       category: category,
       threshold: threshold,  // 1 minute
       applications: [app]
   )
   ```
   - Creates individual events for each app
   - Each event has a 1-minute threshold

3. **DeviceActivity Monitoring** (Lines 945-967):
   ```swift
   let events = monitoredEvents.reduce(into: [:]) { result, entry in
       result[entry.key] = entry.value.deviceActivityEvent()
   }
   try deviceActivityCenter.startMonitoring(activityName, during: schedule, events: events)
   ```
   - Starts monitoring with DeviceActivityCenter
   - Events fire when threshold is reached

4. **Continuous Tracking** (Lines 893-926):
   ```swift
   private let restartInterval: TimeInterval = 120  // 2 minutes

   monitoringRestartTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: restartInterval, repeats: true) {
       try self.scheduleActivity()  // Restart monitoring to reset events
   }
   ```
   - Timer restarts monitoring every **2 minutes**
   - This resets the events so they can fire again
   - Enables tracking beyond the first 1-minute threshold

5. **Usage Recording** (DeviceActivityMonitorExtension.swift, Lines 159-219):
   ```swift
   override func eventDidReachThreshold(_ event: DeviceActivityEvent.Name, activity: DeviceActivityName) {
       recordUsageFromEvent(event)  // Records thresholdSeconds to persistence
   }
   ```
   - When threshold is reached, extension records usage
   - Records the threshold amount (1 minute = 60 seconds)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è THE PROBLEM: Apple's Screen Time API Limitation

### What DeviceActivity Actually Tracks

According to Apple's DeviceActivity framework documentation and observed behavior:

**DeviceActivityEvent tracks "SCREEN TIME" (foreground time), NOT "active usage"**

#### What counts as "screen time":
‚úÖ App is visible on screen and user is actively using it
‚úÖ App is open on screen but user is NOT touching it (idle)
‚úÖ App is in split-screen view (counts even if user is using other app)
‚úÖ App is visible while user is looking at something else
‚úÖ App is in foreground while screen is on (even if locked afterwards)

#### What this means for reward apps:
- User opens reward app ‚Üí timer starts
- User stops interacting but leaves app open ‚Üí **timer continues**
- User switches to another app in split-view ‚Üí **both apps count time**
- User puts phone down with app visible ‚Üí **timer continues**
- Every 1 minute of foreground time ‚Üí event fires ‚Üí usage recorded
- Every 2 minutes ‚Üí monitoring restarts ‚Üí more events can fire

## üî¨ Root Cause Analysis

### Why The Current Implementation Counts Background Time

**File:** `ScreenTimeService.swift`

```
Flow:
1. Reward app opens ‚Üí enters foreground
2. DeviceActivity starts tracking foreground time
3. After 1 minute of foreground time (not interaction) ‚Üí eventDidReachThreshold fires
4. Extension records 60 seconds of usage
5. Main app consumes points based on that usage
6. After 2 minutes total ‚Üí monitoring restarts
7. Another 1 minute of foreground time ‚Üí event fires again
8. Cycle repeats...
```

**The API has NO built-in way to distinguish:**
- App visible + user interacting ‚ùå Cannot detect
- App visible + user idle ‚ùå Cannot detect
- App in focus vs background app ‚úÖ Can detect (foreground/background)

### Apple's Screen Time Definition

From iOS Screen Time settings, "usage" = **time app is visible on screen**, which includes:
- Active use
- Passive viewing
- Idle time with app open
- Split-screen time

This is Apple's design - Screen Time is meant to track "exposure" to apps, not just active interaction.

## üö® Impact on Reward System

### Current Behavior (INCORRECT for your use case):

**Scenario:**
1. User earns 375 points from learning apps
2. User redeems 75 points (15 min) for reward app
3. User opens reward app and actively plays for 2 minutes
4. User **leaves app open** and walks away for 8 minutes
5. Total foreground time: **10 minutes**

**What happens:**
- Event fires at minute 1 ‚Üí 5 points consumed ‚úì
- Event fires at minute 2 ‚Üí 5 points consumed ‚úì (correct - was actually playing)
- Monitoring restarts at minute 2
- Event fires at minute 3 ‚Üí 5 points consumed ‚úó (user not playing)
- Event fires at minute 4 ‚Üí 5 points consumed ‚úó (user not playing)
- ...and so on
- **Total consumed: 50 points** instead of expected 10 points

**Result:** User only got 2 minutes of actual play but was charged for 10 minutes.

---

## üìä Why This Happens

### The DeviceActivity API Design

Apple's `DeviceActivityEvent` with `threshold` parameter:

```swift
DeviceActivityEvent(
    applications: Set<ApplicationToken>,
    threshold: DateComponents  // Triggers after X time in FOREGROUND
)
```

**Documentation (paraphrased):**
> "The event fires when the specified applications have been used for the threshold duration."

**"Used" in Apple's definition = "in foreground"**, not "actively interacting"

This is the same metric used for:
- iOS Screen Time reports
- Parental controls time limits
- App usage statistics

It's designed for **time management and limiting exposure**, not for tracking **active engagement**.

---

## üîç Alternative Approaches (Not Currently Implemented)

### 1. **Interaction-Based Detection** (Requires App-Side Monitoring)
- Monitor touch events, gestures, button presses
- ‚ùå Problem: Can't monitor from DeviceActivity extension
- ‚ùå Problem: Doesn't work when app is in background
- ‚ùå Problem: User could "fake" interaction

### 2. **Motion/Gyroscope Detection**
- Detect device movement as proxy for active use
- ‚ùå Problem: User could be watching video (passive)
- ‚ùå Problem: Doesn't distinguish between apps
- ‚ùå Problem: Requires CoreMotion permissions

### 3. **Heuristic Time Windows**
- Only count usage in short bursts (e.g., 30-second windows)
- Reset if no screen change detected
- ‚ùå Problem: Complex logic, prone to edge cases
- ‚ùå Problem: Still relies on foreground time

### 4. **Manual User Confirmation**
- Require user to "check in" periodically
- ‚ùå Problem: Poor user experience
- ‚ùå Problem: Gameable (user can cheat)

### 5. **Audio/Video Analysis**
- Detect if media is playing
- ‚ùå Problem: Privacy concerns
- ‚ùå Problem: Doesn't cover all app types (games, social media)
- ‚ùå Problem: High battery drain

## üìù Recommendations

### Option A: Accept Screen Time Definition (Simplest)
**Keep current implementation**, but:
- Document that "usage" = "time app is visible on screen"
- Educate users that leaving apps open counts as usage
- Add UI warnings: "Close reward apps when not actively using them"

**Pros:**
- Uses standard iOS Screen Time metrics
- Consistent with Apple's ecosystem
- No additional implementation needed

**Cons:**
- Users charged for idle time
- Not truly "active usage"

---

### Option B: Increase Threshold (Reduce Sensitivity)
**Change from 1-minute to longer intervals:**
```swift
private let defaultThreshold = DateComponents(minute: 5)
```

**Pros:**
- Reduces number of events
- Less sensitive to brief idle periods

**Cons:**
- Less granular tracking
- Still counts foreground time
- Doesn't solve core issue

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Most Accurate, Most Complex)
**Combine DeviceActivity + App-Level Monitoring:**

1. DeviceActivity tracks foreground time (as currently)
2. Main app tracks actual interaction when active:
   - UIApplication state changes
   - Scene activation
   - Touch events via UIResponder
3. Cross-reference both sources
4. Only count periods with both foreground + interaction

**Pros:**
- More accurate "active usage" detection
- Can distinguish idle from active

**Cons:**
- Complex implementation
- Only works when main app is active
- Requires careful state management
- Still has edge cases

---

### Option D: User-Initiated Sessions (Most Transparent)
**Require user to "start" and "stop" reward sessions:**

1. User taps "Start Playing" when they unlock reward app
2. Timer runs while session is active
3. User taps "Stop" when done, or auto-stop after inactivity
4. Only count time in active sessions

**Pros:**
- Most transparent to user
- Accurate active usage
- User controls billing

**Cons:**
- Extra steps for user
- Users might forget to stop
- Can be gameable

## üéØ Conclusion

**Current Implementation Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Correctly implements Apple's DeviceActivity API
- ‚úÖ Tracks "screen time" as Apple defines it
- ‚ùå Does NOT track "active usage" or "interaction"
- ‚ùå Counts foreground time even when user is idle

**The Issue:**
Apple's Screen Time API is designed for **time management and screen exposure**, not **active engagement tracking**. There is no built-in way to distinguish between an app being visible vs. actively used.

**Why This Matters for Your App:**
Your reward system charges points based on usage time. Users expect to be charged for **active play time**, not **time the app is visible**. The current implementation charges for both.

**Bottom Line:**
This is a **fundamental API limitation**, not a bug in your implementation. To fix this properly requires one of the alternative approaches above, each with significant tradeoffs.

---

**Recommendation:**
Start with **Option A** (document the behavior) + **Option B** (increase threshold to 5 minutes) as a quick mitigation. This reduces over-charging while staying within the Screen Time API capabilities.

For a true "active usage" solution, **Option C** (hybrid approach) would be needed, but requires significant additional development and still has limitations.
