# Task M Additional Fixes
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Project:** ScreenTime-BMAD / ScreenTimeRewards
**Author:** Code Agent

## Overview
This document summarizes additional fixes implemented for Task M to address continued cross-category data loss issues. These fixes enhance the picker presentation methods to properly combine selections from both categories when rehydrating `familySelection`.

## Issues Addressed

### Continued Cross-Category Data Loss
- After saving the Reward picker, launching the Learning picker immediately caused both learning and reward snapshots to drop to zero
- The `presentLearningPicker()` and `presentRewardPicker()` methods were not properly combining the selections from both categories when rehydrating `familySelection`

## Solutions Implemented

### Enhanced Picker Presentation Methods
Modified `presentLearningPicker()` and `presentRewardPicker()` to properly combine selections from both categories when rehydrating `familySelection`:

1. **Proper Selection Combination**: Enhanced the methods to properly combine selections from both categories using `union()` operation
2. **Preserved Category/Web Domain Selections**: Ensured that category and web domain selections are preserved when combining selections
3. **Proper State Management**: Ensured that the combined selection includes all apps from both categories while preserving the existing category and web domain selections

### Key Code Changes

#### AppUsageViewModel.swift
- Enhanced `presentLearningPicker()` to properly combine learning and reward selections:
  ```swift
  let learningSelection = selection(for: AppUsage.AppCategory.learning)
  let rewardSelection = selection(for: AppUsage.AppCategory.reward)
  
  var combinedSelection = FamilyActivitySelection()
  combinedSelection.applicationTokens = learningSelection.applicationTokens.union(rewardSelection.applicationTokens)
  
  // Preserve category/web domain selections
  combinedSelection.categoryTokens = masterSelection.categoryTokens
  combinedSelection.webDomainTokens = masterSelection.webDomainTokens
  
  familySelection = combinedSelection
  ```

- Enhanced `presentRewardPicker()` to properly combine reward and learning selections:
  ```swift
  let rewardSelection = selection(for: AppUsage.AppCategory.reward)
  let learningSelection = selection(for: AppUsage.AppCategory.learning)
  
  var combinedSelection = FamilyActivitySelection()
  combinedSelection.applicationTokens = rewardSelection.applicationTokens.union(learningSelection.applicationTokens)
  
  // Preserve category/web domain selections
  combinedSelection.categoryTokens = masterSelection.categoryTokens
  combinedSelection.webDomainTokens = masterSelection.webDomainTokens
  
  familySelection = combinedSelection
  ```

## Validation Results

### Before Fix
- After saving the Reward picker, launching the Learning picker immediately caused both learning and reward snapshots to drop to zero
- Console showed "Skipping orphaned token" diagnostics indicating stale tokens in selections
- Apps from opposite categories were being lost when switching between pickers

### After Fix
- Apps from opposite categories persist when switching between pickers
- No "Skipping orphaned token" diagnostics in console
- Proper combination of selections from both categories when rehydrating `familySelection`
- Enhanced state management during picker presentation

## Successful Tests
1. Apps from opposite categories persist when switching between pickers
2. No "Skipping orphaned token" diagnostics in console
3. Proper combination of selections from both categories when rehydrating `familySelection`
4. Enhanced state management during picker presentation

## Conclusion
The additional Task M fixes have been successfully implemented and address the continued cross-category data loss issues. The picker presentation methods now properly combine selections from both categories when rehydrating `familySelection`, ensuring that apps from opposite categories persist when switching between pickers. These fixes enhance the overall stability and reliability of the app removal flow and picker stability.
