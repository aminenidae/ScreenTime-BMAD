# Pre-Implementation Validation Requirement

## Technical Feasibility Testing
Before any implementation work begins, a comprehensive technical feasibility study must be completed to validate our core concept within Apple's ecosystem restrictions. This requirement ensures we don't invest development resources in building features that may not be technically viable due to Apple's constraints.

## Validation Plan
A detailed technical feasibility testing plan has been created (see docs/technical-feasibility-testing-plan.md) that outlines:
1. Test areas and methodology for validating core functionality
2. Compliance testing for privacy and security requirements
3. Risk assessment for Apple policy changes
4. Success criteria for determining project viability

## Implementation Hold
No development work on the core features should begin until the technical feasibility tests have been completed and the results have been reviewed. Only after successful validation should we proceed with full implementation.
