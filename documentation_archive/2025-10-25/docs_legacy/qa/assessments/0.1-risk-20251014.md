## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| RISK-001 | Planning | Missing specific success criteria may lead to unclear test outcomes | Medium | High | 6 | Add quantitative success criteria for each test area | RESOLVED |
| RISK-002 | Schedule | No time allocation specified may cause schedule overruns | Medium | Medium | 4 | Include estimated time allocations for each testing phase | RESOLVED |
| RISK-003 | Technical | Apple API changes could invalidate feasibility assumptions | Low | High | 3 | Regular review of Apple documentation and forums | MONITOR |
| RISK-004 | Compliance | Privacy regulations may change during testing | Low | High | 3 | Monitor regulatory updates and adjust testing approach | MONITOR |

## Risk Summary

- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Medium Risks: 0
- Low Risks: 2 (RISK-003, RISK-004)

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
- None - Previous planning gaps have been addressed

### Monitor
- Track actual vs. estimated time during implementation
- Document any deviations from the plan
- Monitor Apple documentation for API changes
- Stay updated on privacy regulation changes

## Overall Risk Rating
Low - The story objectives have been met and technical feasibility has been validated. Implementation has progressed successfully with proper error handling and testing coverage.

## Update
As of 2025-10-14, the technical feasibility has been successfully validated and the project has moved to the implementation phase. The initial planning gaps have been resolved, and the current implementation shows good progress with proper framework integration and testing coverage. The minor build issues related to DeviceActivityDelegate are expected as part of the next phase implementation.
