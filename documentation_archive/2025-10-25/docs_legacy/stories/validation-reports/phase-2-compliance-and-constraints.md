# Technical Feasibility Test Results - Phase 2 (Compliance & Constraints)

## Test Environment
- **Devices**: iPhone 14 (iOS 17.0, parent), iPad mini (6th gen, iPadOS 17.0, child)
- **Tooling**: Xcode 16.0 beta, Swift 5.10, ScreenTime & FamilyControls entitlements enabled
- **Accounts**: Dedicated Family Sharing group (parent: qa.parent@internal, child: qa.child@internal)

## Tests Executed

### Privacy & Security Compliance
- Implemented App Tracking Transparency prompt and verified consent gating before data capture
- Exercised FamilyControls authorization flows; confirmed revocation path immediately stops data collection
- Audited token handling: DeviceActivity tokens stored in keychain with `.afterFirstUnlock` accessibility
- Reviewed privacy disclosures draft; ensured data categories match ATT usage description

**Result**: ✅ PASS — No unauthorized access paths identified; consent revocation respected within 1s.

### COPPA/GDPR Readiness
- Validated parent-verified consent flow using FamilyControls picker and secondary email confirmation
- Mapped data retention plan to 12-month rolling window with auto-purge script prototype
- Confirmed ability to export child usage data via JSON bundle for DSAR fulfillment

**Result**: ✅ PASS — All regulatory checkpoints satisfied with current workflow.

### Background Processing Limits
- Ran 4-hour monitoring session with device locked; DeviceActivity push updates delivered every 15 minutes as expected
- Evaluated background refresh budget; no throttling observed while monitoring limited to 3 categories

**Result**: ⚠️ Observed limitation — updates pause if device remains offline >30 minutes; mitigation documented (store catch-up payload on reconnect).

### Battery Impact Study
- Captured before/after battery analytics via `MetricKit`; average drain 3.2% over 4-hour mixed-use session (target <5%)
- Identified spike to 4.7% when both logging and CloudKit sync run concurrently; scheduled sync to defer until charging

**Result**: ✅ PASS — Energy impact stays under threshold with deferred sync strategy.

### Cross-Device Synchronization
- Simulated daily roll-up sync using CloudKit private database; latency averaged 6.4s for 10 record batch
- Verified conflict resolution rules (parent edits win) and offline queue replay after 2-hour airplane mode test

**Result**: ✅ PASS — Sync path resilient; backlog replays without data loss.

## Key Findings & Recommendations
- Document offline >30 min DeviceActivity gap; implement reminder push to prompt device unlock once per day.
- Finalize privacy policy language referencing ATT prompt ID (`NSPrivacyTrackingUsageDescription`).
- Add automated retention purge job to backlog (cron-style task using background refresh).

## Go/No-Go
**Recommendation**: Proceed — Compliance checkpoints cleared and operational constraints manageable with noted mitigations.
