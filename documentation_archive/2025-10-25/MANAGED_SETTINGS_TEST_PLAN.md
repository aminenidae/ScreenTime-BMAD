# ManagedSettings Blocking Test Plan

**Purpose:** Validate Apple's ManagedSettings framework for dynamic app blocking/unlocking
**Date Created:** 2025-10-16
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Core product feature, completely untested

---

## Executive Summary

This is the **HIGHEST PRIORITY** test for the technical feasibility study. The entire product value proposition depends on:
- **FR2:** "Automatically unlock reward apps after targets met"
- **FR13:** "Block all apps except learning apps and authorized apps"
- **FR14:** "Enable parents to set downtime schedules"

**If this doesn't work, the product is not viable.**

---

## Test Objectives

1. ‚úÖ Verify we can block specific apps using ManagedSettings
2. ‚úÖ Verify we can unblock apps dynamically based on criteria
3. ‚úÖ Measure delay between setting change and enforcement
4. ‚úÖ Test parental override functionality
5. ‚úÖ Document shield staleness behavior (research finding)
6. ‚úÖ Test system behavior during offline scenarios
7. ‚úÖ Verify shield time counting (research finding)

---

## Implementation Phase

###  Step 1: Add ManagedSettings to ScreenTimeService

**File:** `ScreenTimeRewards/Services/ScreenTimeService.swift`

**Add imports:**
```swift
import ManagedSettings
```

**Add properties:**
```swift
// ManagedSettings store for app blocking
private let managedSettingsStore = ManagedSettingsStore()

// Track currently shielded (blocked) apps
private var currentlyShielded: Set<ApplicationToken> = []

// Track apps that should always be accessible (learning apps)
private var alwaysAccessible: Set<ApplicationToken> = []
```

**Add methods:**
```swift
/// Block reward apps (shield them)
func blockRewardApps(tokens: Set<ApplicationToken>) {
    #if DEBUG
    print("[ScreenTimeService] Blocking \(tokens.count) reward apps")
    #endif

    currentlyShielded = tokens
    managedSettingsStore.shield.applications = tokens

    #if DEBUG
    print("[ScreenTimeService] ‚úÖ Shield applied to \(tokens.count) apps")
    print("[ScreenTimeService] ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If apps are already running, user must close and reopen")
    #endif

    // Post notification
    NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .rewardAppsBlocked, object: nil)
}

/// Unblock reward apps (remove shield)
func unblockRewardApps(tokens: Set<ApplicationToken>) {
    #if DEBUG
    print("[ScreenTimeService] Unblocking \(tokens.count) reward apps")
    #endif

    // Remove from currently shielded
    currentlyShielded.subtract(tokens)

    // Update ManagedSettings
    managedSettingsStore.shield.applications = currentlyShielded

    #if DEBUG
    print("[ScreenTimeService] ‚úÖ Shield removed from \(tokens.count) apps")
    print("[ScreenTimeService] Currently shielded: \(currentlyShielded.count) apps")
    print("[ScreenTimeService] ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Requires app relaunch to take effect (research finding)")
    #endif

    // Post notification
    NotificationCenter.default.post(
        name: .rewardAppsUnlocked,
        object: nil,
        userInfo: ["requiresRelaunch": true]
    )
}

/// Block ALL apps except learning and system apps
func blockAllExceptLearning(learningTokens: Set<ApplicationToken>) {
    #if DEBUG
    print("[ScreenTimeService] Blocking all apps except \(learningTokens.count) learning apps")
    #endif

    alwaysAccessible = learningTokens

    // Note: We'll need to implement this by blocking specific apps
    // ManagedSettings doesn't have a "block all except" mode
    // This is a limitation to document

    #if DEBUG
    print("[ScreenTimeService] ‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITATION: Cannot block 'all except' - must specify apps to block")
    print("[ScreenTimeService] Workaround: Block known reward apps explicitly")
    #endif
}

/// Get current shield status
func getShieldStatus() -> (blocked: Int, accessible: Int) {
    return (blocked: currentlyShielded.count, accessible: alwaysAccessible.count)
}

/// Clear all shields
func clearAllShields() {
    #if DEBUG
    print("[ScreenTimeService] Clearing all shields")
    #endif

    currentlyShielded.removeAll()
    managedSettingsStore.shield.applications = nil

    #if DEBUG
    print("[ScreenTimeService] ‚úÖ All shields cleared")
    #endif
}
```

**Add notification names:**
```swift
// In ScreenTimeNotifications.swift or extension
extension Notification.Name {
    static let rewardAppsBlocked = Notification.Name("com.screentimerewards.rewardAppsBlocked")
    static let rewardAppsUnlocked = Notification.Name("com.screentimerewards.rewardAppsUnlocked")
}
```

---

### Step 2: Add UI Controls to AppUsageView

**Add to configurationSection:**
```swift
// ManagedSettings Test Controls
Section(header: Text("üß™ ManagedSettings Testing").foregroundColor(.orange)) {
    VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
        Text("Test app blocking/unlocking functionality")
            .font(.caption)
            .foregroundColor(.secondary)

        Button(action: {
            testBlockRewardApps()
        }) {
            HStack {
                Image(systemName: "lock.shield.fill")
                Text("Block Reward Apps")
            }
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.red.opacity(0.8))
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .cornerRadius(8)
        }

        Button(action: {
            testUnblockRewardApps()
        }) {
            HStack {
                Image(systemName: "lock.open.fill")
                Text("Unblock Reward Apps")
            }
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.green.opacity(0.8))
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .cornerRadius(8)
        }

        Button(action: {
            testClearAllShields()
        }) {
            HStack {
                Image(systemName: "shield.slash.fill")
                Text("Clear All Shields")
            }
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.8))
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .cornerRadius(8)
        }

        // Shield status display
        let status = viewModel.getShieldStatus()
        HStack {
            VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                Text("Blocked: \(status.blocked)")
                Text("Accessible: \(status.accessible)")
            }
            .font(.caption)
            .foregroundColor(.secondary)
        }
        .padding(.top, 8)
    }
    .padding()
}
```

**Add ViewModel methods:**
```swift
// In AppUsageViewModel.swift

func testBlockRewardApps() {
    #if DEBUG
    print("[AppUsageViewModel] TEST: Blocking reward apps")
    #endif

    // Get all tokens assigned to "Reward" category
    let rewardTokens = categoryAssignments.filter { $0.value == .reward }.map { $0.key }

    if rewardTokens.isEmpty {
        errorMessage = "No reward apps assigned. Please assign some apps to 'Reward' category first."
        return
    }

    service.blockRewardApps(tokens: Set(rewardTokens))

    #if DEBUG
    print("[AppUsageViewModel] Blocked \(rewardTokens.count) reward apps")
    print("[AppUsageViewModel] Try opening a reward app now - you should see a shield screen")
    #endif
}

func testUnblockRewardApps() {
    #if DEBUG
    print("[AppUsageViewModel] TEST: Unblocking reward apps")
    #endif

    let rewardTokens = categoryAssignments.filter { $0.value == .reward }.map { $0.key }

    if rewardTokens.isEmpty {
        errorMessage = "No reward apps assigned."
        return
    }

    service.unblockRewardApps(tokens: Set(rewardTokens))

    #if DEBUG
    print("[AppUsageViewModel] Unblocked \(rewardTokens.count) reward apps")
    print("[AppUsageViewModel] ‚ö†Ô∏è If app is running, close it completely and reopen")
    #endif
}

func testClearAllShields() {
    #if DEBUG
    print("[AppUsageViewModel] TEST: Clearing all shields")
    #endif

    service.clearAllShields()
}

func getShieldStatus() -> (blocked: Int, accessible: Int) {
    return service.getShieldStatus()
}
```

## Go/No-Go Decision

### Can We Build the Product?

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** Can we dynamically block and unblock apps based on usage criteria?

[ ] ‚úÖ **GO** - Blocking/unlocking works acceptably
[ ] ‚ùå **NO-GO** - Blocking/unlocking doesn't work as needed
[ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONDITIONAL** - Works with significant limitations

### Decision Factors

**If GO:**
- Blocking works with < 5 second delay
- Unlocking works reliably
- Shield staleness is manageable (user can relaunch)
- Time counting issue is minor or fixable

**If NO-GO:**
- Cannot block apps at all
- Cannot unblock dynamically
- Delays > 30 seconds
- Critical bugs or crashes

**If CONDITIONAL:**
- Shield staleness requires UX accommodation
- Time counting requires adjustment to point calculation
- Delays require user messaging
- Limitations require product redesign

1. ‚úÖ Document all findings in feasibility report
2. ‚úÖ Proceed to TestFlight distribution testing
3. ‚úÖ Implement ShieldConfiguration extension (Path 2)
4. ‚úÖ Begin CloudKit multi-device testing

### If TEST FAILS:
1. üî¥ Document failure mode
2. üî¥ Investigate root cause
3. üî¥ Consider alternative approaches:
   - Notification-only system (no enforcement)
   - Category-based blocking only
   - Different Apple framework
4. üî¥ Update stakeholders on findings

### If TEST CONDITIONAL:
