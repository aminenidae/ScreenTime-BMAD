# Build Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The build was failing with the following error:
```
Generic struct 'StateObject' requires that 'AuthenticationService' conform to 'ObservableObject'
```

## Root Cause
In [ModeSelectionView.swift](file:///Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Views/ModeSelectionView.swift), I was using `@StateObject` for [AuthenticationService](file:///Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Services/AuthenticationService.swift#L23-L92):
```swift
@StateObject private var authService = AuthenticationService()
```

However, `@StateObject` requires the class to conform to `ObservableObject`, which [AuthenticationService](file:///Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Services/AuthenticationService.swift#L23-L92) doesn't (and shouldn't, as it's a simple service class without observable properties).

## Solution Applied
Changed `@StateObject` to `@State` for [AuthenticationService](file:///Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Services/AuthenticationService.swift#L23-L92):
```swift
@State private var authService = AuthenticationService()
```

## Explanation
- `@StateObject` is used for observable objects that need to persist through view updates
- `@State` is used for value types or simple classes that don't need to persist as observable objects
- Since [AuthenticationService](file:///Users/ameen/Documents/ScreenTime-BMAD/ScreenTimeRewardsProject/ScreenTimeRewards/Services/AuthenticationService.swift#L23-L92) doesn't have any `@Published` properties and is a simple service class, `@State` is the appropriate choice

This fix resolves the build error and maintains the intended functionality of the mode selection view.
