# Current Status Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Project:** ScreenTime-BMAD / ScreenTimeRewards

---

## 🎯 Active Work

- **Shuffle regression (Oct 21 20:07)** – Snapshot logs show two learning apps resolving to the same logical ID (`AD6095BE…`). Fix `UsagePersistence.resolveLogicalID` so privacy-protected apps always get a fresh UUID.
- **Reward picker context (Task H)** – Reward picker should preselect only reward apps.
- **CategoryAssignmentView build fix (Task I)** – Finish refactor / `using:` updates.
- **Removal & unlock validations (Tasks F & G)** – Pending once the above are stable.

---

## 🔍 Latest Findings

- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.21_20-07-18--0500.xcresult` shows duplicate logical IDs after adding Translate/Weather:
  ```
  [AppUsageViewModel]   1: tokenHash=-7479… logicalID=AD6095BE…
  [AppUsageViewModel]   3: tokenHash=-8924… logicalID=AD6095BE…
  ```
  This reintroduces the original "Unknown App" collision when displayName fallback is used.
- Reward picker still shares `familySelection`; needs isolated selection snapshots before/after save.
- CategoryAssignmentView refactor compiles in isolation but full project build still pending after these fixes.

## ✅ What's Working

- Deterministic ordering logic remains intact in the repo (no changes from commit `a9863cd`).
- Live usage refresh works post-clean build.
- Token persistence, background tracking, cold launch retention remain stable.
- **UI shuffle issue RESOLVED in initial testing** – No card reordering after saving category assignments. Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs. Console logs show stable logical ID and token hash ordering across save cycles. 
- **Pending additional validation tests** to confirm long-term stability.

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. Update `UsagePersistence.resolveLogicalID` to remove the displayName reuse path and always generate a new UUID when no bundle ID exists.
2. Revalidate the shuffle scenario after the fix (Books/News → add Translate/Weather).
3. Continue with Tasks H, I, F, G once the shuffle is resolved.
4. Tag `v0.0.7-alpha` after validation.
