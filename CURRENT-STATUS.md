## üîç Latest Findings

All identified issues have been resolved:
- **Shuffle regression** ‚Äì Fixed by removing displayName fallback in `UsagePersistence.resolveLogicalID` and ensuring privacy-protected apps always get a fresh UUID
- **Reward picker context** ‚Äì Reward picker now preselects only reward apps with isolated selection state
- **CategoryAssignmentView build fix** ‚Äì Refactor completed with all `using:` updates; project builds cleanly
- **Removal & unlock validations** ‚Äì All validations completed successfully

Duplicate logical ID issue resolved:
```
[AppUsageViewModel]   1: tokenHash=-7479‚Ä¶ logicalID=AD6095BE‚Ä¶
[AppUsageViewModel]   3: tokenHash=-8924‚Ä¶ logicalID=AD6095BE‚Ä¶
```
This collision has been eliminated by removing the displayName fallback path.
