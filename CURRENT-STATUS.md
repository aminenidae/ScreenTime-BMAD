# Current Status Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Project:** ScreenTime-BMAD / ScreenTimeRewards

## üéØ Active Work

- **Shuffle regression (Oct‚ÄØ21 20:07)** ‚Äì Snapshot logs show two learning apps resolving to the same logical ID (`AD6095BE‚Ä¶`). Fix `UsagePersistence.resolveLogicalID` so privacy-protected apps always get a fresh UUID.
- **Reward picker context (Task‚ÄØH)** ‚Äì Reward picker should preselect only reward apps.
- **CategoryAssignmentView build fix (Task‚ÄØI)** ‚Äì Finish refactor / `using:` updates.
- **Removal & unlock validations (Tasks‚ÄØF & G)** ‚Äì Pending once the above are stable.

## üîç Latest Findings

- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.21_20-07-18--0500.xcresult` shows duplicate logical IDs after adding Translate/Weather:
  ```
  [AppUsageViewModel]   1: tokenHash=-7479‚Ä¶ logicalID=AD6095BE‚Ä¶
  [AppUsageViewModel]   3: tokenHash=-8924‚Ä¶ logicalID=AD6095BE‚Ä¶
  ```
  This reintroduces the original "Unknown App" collision when displayName fallback is used.
- Reward picker still shares `familySelection`; needs isolated selection snapshots before/after save.
- CategoryAssignmentView refactor compiles in isolation but full project build still pending after these fixes.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

- Deterministic ordering logic remains intact in the repo (no changes from commit `a9863cd`).
- Live usage refresh works post-clean build.
- Token persistence, background tracking, cold launch retention remain stable.
- **UI shuffle issue RESOLVED in initial testing** ‚Äì No card reordering after saving category assignments. Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs. Console logs show stable logical ID and token hash ordering across save cycles. 
- **Pending additional validation tests** to confirm long-term stability.

## üîß Next Steps

1. Update `UsagePersistence.resolveLogicalID` to remove the displayName reuse path and always generate a new UUID when no bundle ID exists.
2. Revalidate the shuffle scenario after the fix (Books/News ‚Üí add Translate/Weather).
3. Continue with Tasks‚ÄØH,‚ÄØI,‚ÄØF,‚ÄØG once the shuffle is resolved.
4. Tag `v0.0.7-alpha` after validation.
