## üéØ Active Work

**‚úÖ CRITICAL BUG FIXES COMPLETED** (2025-10-26)

Three critical bugs in points calculation and state persistence have been identified and fixed:
1. Points calculation bug (retroactive recalculation issue)
2. Configuration reload bug (rate changes not applied to in-memory state)
3. Unlocked reward app persistence bug (using unstable token hash)

**‚úÖ REWARD TRANSFER SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED** (2025-10-25)

The reward transfer feature has been successfully implemented and builds without errors. Users can now transfer reward points between apps and categories.

**‚úÖ CATEGORY SELECTION ISSUE RESOLVED** (2025-10-25)

The "All Apps" edge case and category selection issue has been successfully resolved using Apple's official `includeEntireCategory` flag. All category selections now properly expand to individual app tokens.

## üîç Latest Findings & Resolution

### Points Calculation Bugs (RESOLVED ‚úÖ) - Oct 26, 2025

**Problem:** Three critical bugs affecting points calculation and state persistence:

#### Bug 1: Retroactive Points Recalculation
- **Issue:** Changing points/minute retroactively recalculated ALL historical usage with new rate
- **Example:** 1 min at 75pts + change to 230pts + 2 min = 225pts (wrong) instead of 535pts (correct)
- **Root Cause:** `earnedRewardPoints` was a computed property: `totalTime / 60 * currentRate`
- **Fix:** Changed to stored property, incrementally adding points in `recordUsage()` method
- **Files:** `Models/AppUsage.swift:95,186-188`

#### Bug 2: Configuration Reload
- **Issue:** When user changed points/minute, new rate saved to disk but in-memory AppUsage kept old rate
- **Root Cause:** `configureMonitoring()` reused existing in-memory AppUsage instead of reloading from persistence
- **Fix:** Always reload AppUsage from persistence to get updated configuration
- **Files:** `Services/ScreenTimeService.swift:612-617`

#### Bug 3: App Card Display
- **Issue:** App cards recalculated points using current rate instead of showing actual earned points
- **Root Cause:** Views calculated `totalSeconds / 60 * currentRate` instead of using stored value
- **Fix:** Added `earnedPoints` field to snapshots, display actual earned points in views
- **Files:**
  - `ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift:14,26,490,500,512`
  - `Views/LearningTabView.swift:180`

#### Bug 4: Unlocked Reward Apps Reset After Relaunch
- **Issue:** Unlocked reward apps showed as locked after app relaunch (but remained functionally unlocked)
- **Root Cause:** Used unstable `token.hashValue` which changes on each app launch for token matching
- **Fix:** Switched to stable SHA-256 `tokenHash` for token identification
- **Files:**
  - `Models/AppUsage.swift:41,50` (UnlockedRewardApp initializers)
  - `ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift:1523-1526,1670-1671` (token matching)

**Status:** ‚úÖ ALL FIXED AND TESTED

**Key Changes:**
- Points now locked in when earned (changing rate only affects future usage)
- Configuration changes apply immediately to in-memory state
- App cards show accurate earned points
- Unlocked reward apps persist correctly across app restarts

### Category Selection Fix (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)

**Problem:** When users selected entire categories (e.g., "All Social Apps"), the system received only a category token, not individual app tokens.

**Solution Discovered:** Apple's official `includeEntireCategory` flag in `FamilyActivitySelection` (available since iOS 15.2).

**Implementation:**
- Updated all 21+ `FamilyActivitySelection` initializations to use `includeEntireCategory: true`
- Verified JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder usage (required for proper persistence)
- Removed experimental tab (no longer needed)

**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - User confirmed successful operation

**Files Modified:**
- `ViewModels/AppUsageViewModel.swift` (11 instances)
- `Services/ScreenTimeService.swift` (3 instances)
- `Views/LearningTabView.swift` (1 instance)
- `Views/RewardsTabView.swift` (1 instance)
- `Views/CategoryAssignmentView.swift` (1 instance)
- `Views/MainTabView.swift` (experimental tab removed)
- `Views/ExperimentalCategoryExpansionView.swift` (deleted)

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ **Category selections fully operational** - Categories properly expand to individual app tokens
- ‚úÖ FamilyActivityPicker integration with proper token handling
- ‚úÖ DeviceActivity monitoring with custom thresholds
- ‚úÖ Duplicate-prevention guard validated on-device
- ‚úÖ Learning and Reward tab snapshots refresh immediately after picker save
- ‚úÖ Master selection merges persist across monitor restarts
- ‚úÖ **Point consumption tracking** - Reserved points decrease as reward apps are used (BF-1 FIXED)
- ‚úÖ **Shield management** - All apps remain properly shielded when locking one app (BF-2 FIXED)
- ‚úÖ Blocking/unblocking behaves as expected
- ‚úÖ Logical IDs stay unique for privacy-protected apps
- ‚úÖ Background monitoring loop continues to function after category changes

### Data Management
- ‚úÖ App removal properly cleans up all state including shields, usage data, and points
- ‚úÖ Category assignments persist correctly
- ‚úÖ Reward points persist correctly
- ‚úÖ Usage data persists across app restarts
- ‚úÖ JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder properly handles FamilyActivitySelection

### UI/UX
- ‚úÖ Picker presentation includes retry logic and error handling
- ‚úÖ Removal flow properly implemented
- ‚úÖ Category assignment workflow functional
- ‚úÖ Two-tab interface clean and focused (Rewards + Learning)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Minor Issues

- Picker presentation flicker on first launch (deferred - minor UX polish, doesn't affect functionality)
- Console logs showing `Label is no longer part of the view hierarchy` warnings (benign, doesn't affect functionality)

**Recently Fixed (Oct 25-26, 2025):**
- ‚úÖ Points calculation retroactive recalculation bug (Oct 26)
- ‚úÖ Configuration reload not applying to in-memory state (Oct 26)
- ‚úÖ App cards showing incorrect points (Oct 26)
- ‚úÖ Unlocked reward apps appearing locked after relaunch (Oct 26)
- ‚úÖ Point consumption tracking (BF-1, Oct 25)
- ‚úÖ Shield management formUnion fix (BF-2, Oct 25)
- ‚úÖ Background counting bug (BF-0, Oct 25)

## üîß Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)
1. Continue validation testing with various category types (Games, Social, Productivity, etc.)
2. Monitor for edge cases with category selections
3. Test persistence across device reboots

### Future Enhancements (Deferred)
1. Address picker presentation flicker if a quick fix surfaces
2. ~~Consider point transfer feature (Phase 2, if desired)~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
3. Additional UI polish and refinements
4. Performance optimizations

## üìö Key Learnings

### Technical Discoveries
1. **Official Apple Solution:** `FamilyActivitySelection(includeEntireCategory: true)` is the proper way to handle category selections
2. **Persistence Requirement:** Must use JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder - PropertyListEncoder has a bug that drops the `includeEntireCategory` flag
3. **Privacy Design:** App tokens remain opaque; use `Label(token)` to display names/icons in UI
4. **iOS Version:** `includeEntireCategory` requires iOS 15.2+ (well within our target deployment)

### Process Learnings
1. Always research official Apple solutions before building workarounds
2. Developer community resources (Stack Overflow, forums, documentation PDFs) are valuable
3. Experimental prototyping helped validate the problem, even though the final solution was simpler
