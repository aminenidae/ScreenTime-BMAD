# Current Status Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Project:** ScreenTime-BMAD / ScreenTimeRewards

---

## 🎯 Active Work

- **Picker presentation flicker (Oct 24 evening)** – First launch still flashes the picker sheet and logs repeated “Label is already or no longer part of the view hierarchy” warnings. We agreed to defer unless a quick fix surfaces.
- **Awaiting new QA tickets** – PM will provide the next set of issues once documentation is updated with the latest validation.

---

## 🔍 Latest Findings

- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.24_19-53-20--0500.xcresult` re-run confirms category guard behaviour: reward tokens stay in Reward, learning tokens remain isolated, and the app blocks cross-category duplicates even after multiple picker sessions.
- Immediate post-picker sheet presentations now display the expected apps, but the console still reports presentation warnings (`Attempt to present … while a presentation is in progress`) indicating the presentation flicker remains.

## ✅ What's Working

- Duplicate-prevention guard validated on-device; Reward flows can no longer claim Learning apps and vice versa.
- Learning and Reward tab snapshots refresh immediately after picker save, showing the correct apps without relaunches.
- Master selection merges persist across monitor restarts; blocking/unblocking still behaves as expected.
- Previous shuffle regression remains resolved — logical IDs stay unique for privacy-protected apps.
- Background monitoring loop (restart timer + Darwin notifications) continues to function after category changes.

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. Timebox a spike on picker presentation sequencing; if the flicker fix is quick, land it, otherwise park for a later sprint.
2. Capture an updated device run once any presentation tweaks land, then sync with PM for the next backlog items.
