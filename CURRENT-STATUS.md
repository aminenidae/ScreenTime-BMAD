# Current Status Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Project:** ScreenTime-BMAD / ScreenTimeRewards

---

## üéØ Active Work

- **Picker presentation flicker (Oct‚ÄØ24 evening)** ‚Äì First launch still flashes the picker sheet; deferred unless a quick fix surfaces.

---

## üîç Latest Findings

- All critical issues identified in the previous status have been resolved:
  - Reward picker remote-view crash (`ActivityPickerRemoteViewError error 1`) has been fixed
  - Reward removal cleanup now properly removes apps from all lists
  - Re-adding apps now starts with a clean slate
  - Removal UX messaging has been implemented
  - Picker presentation flicker remains but is deferred

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

- Duplicate-prevention guard validated on-device; Reward flows can no longer claim Learning apps and vice versa.
- Learning and Reward tab snapshots refresh immediately after picker save, showing the correct apps without relaunches.
- Master selection merges persist across monitor restarts; blocking/unblocking still behaves as expected.
- Previous shuffle regression remains resolved ‚Äî logical IDs stay unique for privacy-protected apps.
- Background monitoring loop (restart timer + Darwin notifications) continues to function after category changes.
- App removal now properly cleans up all state including shields, usage data, and points
- Picker presentation now includes retry logic and error handling
- **Task M is now complete** - All removal flow issues have been resolved

---

## üîß Next Steps

1. Timebox a spike on picker presentation sequencing; if the flicker fix is quick, land it, otherwise park for a later sprint.
2. Continue validation testing and documentation updates
