# Development Handoff Brief
**Date:** 2025-10-23 (Duplicate Assignment Regression)
**Project:** ScreenTime-BMAD / ScreenTimeRewards
**Status:** ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS â€“ Duplicate guard fires, but sheet shows zero apps because new picker tokens arenâ€™t passed through.

---

## Executive Summary
- Shared view model and hash-index guard are working; adding Books to Reward now triggers the conflict banner.
- The latest build feeds `CategoryAssignmentView` an empty list because we filter against persisted assignments only; newly picked tokens havenâ€™t been written yet.
- Result: sheet renders with no rows, and saving drops reward picks into the Learning list.

---

## Outstanding Work
1. Capture the pickerâ€™s `FamilyActivitySelection` when it closes and provide those tokens to `CategoryAssignmentView` while the sheet is open.
2. Update `CategoryAssignmentView` to render entries from that pending selection when `fixedCategory` is set, while still merging into `categoryAssignments` on save.
3. Re-run Books/News duplicate test once the above lands; confirm warning banner still appears and tab views remain correct after relaunch.
4. Update documentation with the passing evidence.

---

## Completed Fixes
- Shared `AppUsageViewModel` injected across tabs.
- Single sheet presenter driven by picker context.
- Hash-index duplicate guard now blocks reward duplicates (see `12-39-57` log).

---

## Validation Artifacts
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.23_21-46-57--0500.xcresult` â€” Sheet empty because pending picker tokens werenâ€™t supplied; saving moved reward picks into Learning.
- Prior successes/failures: `â€¦12-39-57`, `â€¦12-24-00`, `â€¦22-45-59`, etc.

---

## Code Status (Octâ€¯23)
- `AppUsageViewModel.swift` â€” Shared instance with hash-index validator; needs pending-selection handling.
- `CategoryAssignmentView.swift` â€” Merge logic intact; awaiting pending-selection feed for display.
- Project builds; release blocked pending Taskâ€¯0/M/N validation.
