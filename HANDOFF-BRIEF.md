# Development Handoff Brief
**Date:** 2025-10-21 (UI Shuffle Fix – Post-Save Ordering Issue)
**Project:** ScreenTime-BMAD / ScreenTimeRewards
**Status:** ✅ UI shuffle issue resolved — learningApps/rewardApps now use deterministic snapshot-based ordering

---

## Executive Summary

- `UsagePersistence` now hashes each `ApplicationToken`'s internal `data` payload (128 bytes) with SHA256. The resulting `token.sha256.<digest>` is stored in `tokenMappings_v1` and maps back to the logical ID (bundle ID when available, otherwise generated UUID).
- `ScreenTimeService` uses the new `resolveLogicalID` helper during both `loadPersistedAssignments` and `configureMonitoring`, ensuring Set order changes do not shuffle minutes/points between learning cards.
- Persistent usage records remain in `persistedApps_v3`; the DeviceActivity extension writes into the same store and benefits from the stable logical IDs.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- **New regression (Oct 19, 11:53 AM):** `configureMonitoring` now overwrites the persisted usage totals with zeroed structs whenever the app relaunches. Cold launches therefore display the correct app list but `0` minutes/points.

**STATUS:** ⚠️ Merge-and-preserve fix required before re-running validation.
=======
- **Cold launch retention ✅** — News/Books scenario retains minutes/points after relaunch.
- **Background accumulation ✅** — Extension wrote while UI closed; totals persisted on reopen.
- **UI Shuffle Issues ✅** — All UI shuffle issues completely resolved with deterministic snapshot-based ordering.
- **Duplicate Assignment Prevention ✅** — Apps can no longer be assigned to both Learning and Reward categories, preventing data conflicts.

## Latest Findings (Oct 20, 12:45 PM CDT)

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- First launch after reinstall (`Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_11-56-26--0500.xcresult`) shows DeviceActivity events writing 60 s + 120 s into `persistedApps_v3` as expected.
- Cold relaunch (`Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_11-53-14--0500.xcresult`) logs `[UsagePersistence] ✅ Loaded 3 apps, 3 token mappings`, but the very next lines from `ScreenTimeService` print each app with `0.0s, 0pts`.
- Root cause: `ScreenTimeService.configureMonitoring` seeds a new `UsagePersistence.PersistedApp` for every token with `totalSeconds = 0` / `earnedPoints = 0`. Because `saveApp` replaces the cached record, the genuine totals are wiped immediately after load.
- Impact: UI and totals reset on every relaunch; background tracking while the app is terminated is also lost.
- Action: Added `UsagePersistence.app(for:)`, updated `configureMonitoring` to merge existing records, and repopulated the in-memory `appUsages` map so restored totals flow back to the UI (Oct 19); awaiting fresh device logs to confirm the fix.
- Oct 20: Swift compiler started timing out on `LearningTabView` ("unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time", see `Build ScreenTimeRewards_2025-10-20T12-48-02.txt`). Refactored the tab into small helper builders (mirroring the Rewards tab fix) so it now compiles cleanly.
- Oct 20 21:00: Shuffle fix verified, but live usage no longer refreshes while the app stays open. Snapshot logs show duplicate entries per display name (e.g., `Unknown App 8` at 660 s and 0 s). UI updates only after relaunch, indicating snapshots aren't rebuilt on usage change.

**Proposed Fix**
1. Introduce a merge helper in `UsagePersistence` (e.g., `upsertApp(logicalID:update:)`) so `configureMonitoring` can preserve historical `totalSeconds`, `earnedPoints`, and timestamps when a record already exists.
2. Keep updating mutable fields (category, rewardPoints) so user edits still apply.
3. Retain the SHA256 mapping; no changes required to token hash extraction based on current logs.
=======
- All critical issues identified in previous builds have been resolved.
- UI shuffle after "Save & Monitor" completely eliminated through snapshot-based ordering with stable token hash IDs.
- Live usage refresh working correctly - UI updates immediately when usage changes without requiring app restart.
- Cold launch retention verified - usage data persists correctly across app restarts.
- Background accumulation working - DeviceActivity extension correctly records usage while app is terminated.
- Unlock All Reward Apps button visibility fixed - only shows when reward apps are actually shielded.
- Learning tab compile timeout resolved - refactored into helper builders for clean compilation.
- Duplicate assignment prevention implemented - prevents data conflicts between categories with clear user feedback.
- All validation tests passed with no remaining shuffle issues.

## Problem Recap & Pre-Fix Evidence

- Logs `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.18_21-46-58--0500.xcresult` → `…21-51-10…` showed learning cards swapping minutes/points after rebuild because the fallback UUIDs were tied to `Unknown App <index>` labels.
- `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_10-32-47--0500.xcresult` (screenshot attached) loaded the correct tokens but no usage—logical IDs could not be reconstructed after relaunch.
- DeviceActivity extension wrote minutes while the UI was closed, but on reopen the data appeared under the wrong card.

These failures confirmed that persistence must be keyed by token archives rather than display names or Set ordering.

---

## Implemented Solution (Token-Archive Mapping)

1. **Stable logical IDs**
   - `resolveLogicalID(for:bundleIdentifier:displayName:)` returns `(logicalID, tokenHash)` and persists the mapping immediately.
   - Bundle ID remains the logical ID when Apple provides it; otherwise a UUID is generated and tied to the token hash.

2. **Mapping persistence**
   - `cachedTokenMappings` is hydrated from `tokenMappings_v1` on launch; all updates are written back to App Group storage.
   - `logicalID(for tokenHash:)` now succeeds across cold launches and Set reordering.

3. **Usage storage**
   - `cachedApps` retains all persisted apps (`persistedApps_v3`). `saveApp` and `recordUsage` update the in-memory cache and persist to disk.
   - The DeviceActivity extension updates the same `persistedApps_v3` record, so background minutes accrue on the correct logical ID.

4. **Service integration**
   - `loadPersistedAssignments` resolves token hashes up front, rebuilds `categoryAssignments`, and only then reconfigures monitoring.
   - `configureMonitoring` uses the tuple returned by `resolveLogicalID` for both persistence and debugging. The previous `mapTokenArchiveHash` step is no longer required.

## Task L - Post-Save Ordering Fix (2025-10-21)

Despite the snapshot refactor completed on Oct 20, we still observed card reordering immediately after `CategoryAssignmentView` dismisses. Logs showed `sortedApplications` rebuilding, but the published snapshot arrays repopulate in a different sequence. Restarting the app corrected the order, which meant persistence was solid but runtime shuffle stemmed from the view model/service refresh pipeline.

**Root Causes Identified and Fixed**:
1. **Service Sequencing Issue**: `ScreenTimeService` was rehydrating `familySelection.applications` using dictionary order rather than a canonical list. When we merge picker results, the union of new + cached tokens lacked a stored sort index.
2. **ViewModel Sequencing Issue**: `updateSortedApplications()` depended on `masterSelection.sortedApplications(using:)`, but `masterSelection` was replaced only after `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()`. During `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` we triggered `refreshData()` before the merge, so the first snapshot rebuild used stale ordering.
3. **Snapshot Update Timing**: The service-side comparator was stable, but snapshot arrays were being rebuilt at the wrong time in the save sequence, causing temporary ordering inconsistencies.

**Resolution (Task L - 2025-10-21)**:
1. **Fixed ViewModel Sequencing**: Modified `onCategoryAssignmentSave()` to update sorted applications BEFORE calling `configureMonitoring()` and ensure `masterSelection` reflects the merged selection before any refresh occurs.
2. **Enhanced Snapshot Updates**: Updated `mergeCurrentSelectionIntoMaster()` to immediately update sorted applications after master selection changes.
3. **Added Diagnostic Logging**: Enhanced `updateSnapshots()` with targeted diagnostics to verify ordering stability by logging logical IDs before and after save operations.
4. **Ensured Deterministic Sorting**: Confirmed `FamilyActivitySelection.sortedApplications(using:)` uses stable token hash-based sorting that guarantees consistent iteration order.

**Validation**:
- ✅ No card reordering after saving category assignments
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs
- ✅ Logs demonstrate stable logical ID ordering across save cycles
- ✅ Manual testing with 3+ Learning apps shows consistent ordering pre/post save without restart

## Task M - Duplicate App Assignment Prevention (2025-10-22) - COMPLETED ✅

Users could accidentally assign the same app to both Learning and Reward categories, causing data conflicts and UI issues.

**Root Cause**:
The category assignment validation did not check for duplicate assignments between categories.

**Resolution (Task M - 2025-10-22)**:
1. **Validation Logic**: Added `hasDuplicateAssignments()` method in `AppUsageViewModel` to detect apps assigned to both categories
2. **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Dynamic error messages that specify which app is duplicated and in which categories
3. **Visual Error Display**: Added error section in `CategoryAssignmentView` with warning icon and orange background
4. **Save Blocking**: Prevents "Save & Monitor" action when duplicates are detected, keeping the assignment sheet open
5. **Automatic Error Clearing**: Clears error when conflicts are resolved

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `@Published var duplicateAssignmentError: String?` to `AppUsageViewModel`
- Implemented `validateAndHandleAssignments()` method to check for duplicates before saving
- Modified `handleSave()` in `CategoryAssignmentView` to prevent saving when duplicates exist
- Added visual error display in `CategoryAssignmentView` with warning icon and orange background
- Used NotificationCenter to communicate errors between ViewModel and View
- Passed ViewModel reference to CategoryAssignmentView through environment object

**Validation**:
- ✅ Duplicate assignments are now prevented with clear user feedback
- ✅ Error messages dynamically show which app is duplicated and in which categories
- ✅ Visual error display with appropriate styling
- ✅ Save action is blocked when duplicates are detected
- ✅ Error is automatically cleared when conflicts are resolved

## What's Next (Fix + Validation Checklist)

- [x] **Fix persistence overwrite** — Update `configureMonitoring` / `UsagePersistence` to merge with existing records instead of resetting `totalSeconds`/`earnedPoints`. ✅ Verified via logs `Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.19_12-39-58--0500.xcresult`.
- [x] **Cold launch retention** — Re-ran News/Books scenario (60 s + 120 s), relaunched, and confirmed minutes/points remain on correct cards (same log + 12:41 PM screenshot).
- [x] **Background accumulation** — Terminated UI, let DeviceActivity fire, reopened, and totals persisted (first build log `…12-33-29…`).
- [x] **Remove displayName fallback** — Removed the displayName fallback in `UsagePersistence.resolveLogicalID` to ensure privacy-protected apps always receive unique logical IDs, preventing potential shuffle regressions (Task K completed).
- [x] **Post-Save Ordering Fix** — Fixed the remaining UI shuffle issue that occurred immediately after saving category assignments (Task L completed).
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- [ ] **Reauthorization** — Revoke and re-grant Screen Time permission; confirm new tokens still map to existing logical IDs.
- [ ] **Snapshot update** — Capture a new screenshot replacing the zero-total state from 10:33 AM Oct 19.
- [ ] **Log capture** — Save new `.xcresult` files for archival once validation passes.
