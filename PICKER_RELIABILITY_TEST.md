## Next Steps

Based on test results:

### If ALL TESTS PASS:
‚úÖ Proceed to **Task 2: ManagedSettings Blocking Implementation**
- Create ManagedSettings test suite
- Implement app blocking functionality
- Test dynamic unlocking

### If SOME TESTS FAIL:
‚ö†Ô∏è Review failures and determine:
- Are failures reproducible?
- Are they showstoppers or minor issues?
- Can we proceed with ManagedSettings testing in parallel?

### If MAJOR FAILURES:
üî¥ Address critical issues before proceeding:
- Document failure patterns
- Investigate root cause
- Consider alternative picker strategies
