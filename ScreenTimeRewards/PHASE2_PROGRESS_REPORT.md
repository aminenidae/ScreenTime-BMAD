# Phase 2 Implementation Progress Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made in implementing the DeviceActivity integration for the ScreenTime Rewards application.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ DeviceActivityCenter Integration
- [x] Restored DeviceActivityCenter usage in `ScreenTimeService.swift`
- [x] Implemented schedule/start/stop helpers with error propagation
- [x] Replaced placeholder authorization calls with production-ready code paths (async/await + continuation bridge for iOS 15)
- [x] Seeded deterministic sample data through the service for demo/tests
- [x] Verified clean build with Screen Time frameworks linked

### ✅ Framework & Configuration Updates
- [x] Verified DeviceActivity and FamilyControls frameworks import/link correctly
- [x] Confirmed Family Controls entitlements/capabilities in the project
- [x] Raised minimum deployment target to iOS 15 to match API availability
- [x] Removed stale `SceneDelegate` reference that caused launch crashes

### ✅ Basic Functionality & Testing
- [x] Added inline error messaging when authorization fails
- [x] Extended unit tests to cover sample seeding and monitoring state transitions
- [x] Updated integration script to target physical devices (skips unsupported simulator runs)
- [x] Verified build succeeds with the new tests and scripts in place

## Current Implementation Status

### ScreenTimeService.swift
Current implementation highlights:

1. **Initialization** – Singleton owns a `DeviceActivityCenter` instance and lazily seeds demo data
2. **Authorization** – Async flow handles iOS 16+ (`for: .individual`) and bridges the iOS 15 completion handler with `withCheckedThrowingContinuation`
3. **Monitoring Control** – `startMonitoring`/`stopMonitoring` update internal state and forward success/failure through completion handlers
4. **Sample Data** – `bootstrapSampleDataIfNeeded()` supplies consistent `AppUsage` entries until real Screen Time events are wired up

### Test Coverage
- Service instantiation tests: ✅ Pass
- Sample data seeding tests: ✅ Pass
- Monitoring start/stop completion tests: ✅ Pass
- Build verification: ✅ Success

## Next Implementation Steps

### 1. DeviceActivityDelegate Implementation
- [ ] Implement `deviceActivityDidBegin(_:)`
- [ ] Implement `deviceActivityWillStart(_:)`
- [ ] Implement `deviceActivityDidEnd(_:reason:)`
- [ ] Feed delegate callbacks into persistence/view model updates

### 2. Data Collection and Processing
- [ ] Map DeviceActivity events into concrete `AppUsage` updates
- [ ] Categorize bundles and accumulate duration totals
- [ ] Replace seeded demo data with live metrics
- [ ] Persist usage snapshots for offline viewing

### 3. Family Controls Integration
- [ ] Present the Family Controls picker/authorization UI
- [ ] Persist and observe authorization status
- [ ] Handle account/family configuration edge cases

### 4. UI Integration
- [ ] Drive `AppUsageViewModel` from real data store
- [ ] Reflect authorization/monitoring state transitions in the UI
- [ ] Add user flows for managing selected learning/reward apps

## Technical Details

### Current API Usage
```swift
// DeviceActivityCenter initialization
deviceActivityCenter = DeviceActivityCenter()

// Schedule creation
let schedule = DeviceActivitySchedule(
    intervalStart: DateComponents(hour: 0, minute: 0),
    intervalEnd: DateComponents(hour: 23, minute: 59),
    repeats: true
)

// Authorization (iOS 16+ or bridged to iOS 15)
if #available(iOS 16.0, *) {
    try await AuthorizationCenter.shared.requestAuthorization(for: .individual)
} else {
    try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
        AuthorizationCenter.shared.requestAuthorization { result in
            switch result {
            case .success:
                continuation.resume()
            case .failure(let error):
                continuation.resume(throwing: error)
            }
        }
    }
}

// Activity monitoring
let activityName = DeviceActivityName("ScreenTimeTracking")
try deviceActivityCenter.startMonitoring(activityName, during: schedule)
deviceActivityCenter.stopMonitoring([activityName])
```

### Framework Integration
- DeviceActivity.framework: Properly linked and imported
- FamilyControls.framework: Properly linked and imported
- Entitlements: Family Controls capability enabled

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- ✅ AppUsage model tests passing
- ✅ Time formatting tests passing
- ✅ Category management tests passing
- ✅ ScreenTimeService sample data & monitoring tests passing

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Physical-device build verification script updated (requires connected device)
- ⏳ DeviceActivity event handling (pending implementation)
- ⏳ Real data collection (pending implementation)
- ⏳ Family Controls integration (pending implementation)

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Proper framework usage
- ✅ Clean code structure
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions

### Build Status
- ✅ Clean builds successful
- ✅ Test builds successful
- ✅ No linker errors
- ✅ Proper framework linking

## Risks and Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- Requires iOS 15.0+ for Screen Time APIs in use
- Requires physical device for accurate testing
- Requires Family Sharing setup for full functionality

### Testing Limitations
- Simulator has limited ScreenTime functionality
- Real data collection requires physical device testing
- Family Controls require proper entitlements and capabilities

## Timeline Estimate

### Remaining Implementation
- DeviceActivityDelegate: 1-2 days
- Data Collection: 2-3 days
- Family Controls Integration: 1-2 days
- Testing and Refinement: 1-2 days

### Total Estimated Time
3-7 days for complete Phase 2 implementation

## Success Criteria

### Phase 2 Completion
- [ ] Actual ScreenTime data collection working
- [ ] Family sharing setup functional
- [ ] App categorization accurate
- [ ] Data persistence implemented
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] No critical bugs identified

## Conclusion

The foundation for DeviceActivity integration has been successfully implemented. The ScreenTimeService now properly initializes DeviceActivityCenter and provides methods for scheduling and controlling monitoring activities. The next steps involve implementing the delegate methods to handle actual ScreenTime events and collecting real usage data.

This progress represents a significant milestone in the Phase 2 implementation, moving from simulated data to actual ScreenTime API integration.
