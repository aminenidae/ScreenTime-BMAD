# Phase 2 Implementation Progress Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made in implementing real ScreenTime API integration for the ScreenTime Rewards application.

## Completed Work

### ✅ DeviceActivity Monitoring Foundations
- Restored `DeviceActivityCenter` usage and refactored scheduling/start/stop logic with robust error propagation
- Added monitoring configuration pipeline (`configureMonitoring`) that maps `FamilyActivitySelection` into event thresholds
- Introduced live usage notifications and `recordUsage` helpers so DeviceActivity events produce `AppUsage` updates
- Created a `ScreenTimeActivityMonitor` bridge to consume DeviceActivity callbacks (awaits extension hookup)

### ✅ Family Controls UX Hooks
- Exposed `FamilyActivityPicker` in the main UI with per-category threshold steppers
- Persisted selection state in `AppUsageViewModel` and applied settings via the service
- Added debug/testing utilities (`configureForTesting`, `simulateEvent`) to validate thresholds without device events

### ✅ Testing & Tooling
- Extended unit suites to cover simulated DeviceActivity events
- Updated integration script guidance for device builds
- Documented device test flow and monitoring configuration steps for teammates

## Current Implementation Snapshot

### ScreenTimeService.swift
1. Initializes DeviceActivityCenter and seeds demo data
2. Manages authorization for iOS 15+ (async/await or continuation bridge)
3. Schedules monitoring with per-category DeviceActivity events derived from family selections
4. Records usage durations when events fire and broadcasts changes via NotificationCenter
5. Provides debug helpers for unit tests and developer simulation

### AppUsageViewModel.swift
- Maintains monitoring state, threshold configuration, and selected apps
- Observes usage change notifications and updates UI totals
- Surfaces errors and controls picker presentation

### AppUsageView.swift
- Presents status, category summaries, and live usage list
- Adds monitoring configuration section with threshold steppers and “Apply” button
- Includes toolbar access to the Family Activity picker

## In-Flight / Next Steps

### DeviceActivity Extension (High Priority)
- Build the Device Activity Monitor extension target
- Forward extension callbacks into `ScreenTimeService` via the new monitor delegate

### Data Persistence & Sync
- Store recorded usage sessions (Core Data / CloudKit) for offline access
- Sync thresholds and configuration across devices

### Reward Engine & Authorization UX
- Expand UI to surface selected apps/categories and status of authorization
- Integrate parental approval and reward calculations once live data is flowing

## Testing Status
- Unit tests: ✅ Pass (model, view model, service, simulated events)
- Integration: ⚠️ Pending DeviceActivity extension (requires on-device testing)
- Manual smoke: ✅ UI configuration flows on-device with seeded data

## Risks & Mitigations
- **DeviceActivity extension not yet implemented** → Target next sprint; without it live data won’t appear
- **FamilyControls authorization UX** still basic → design improvements planned post extension hookup
- **Data persistence** pending → current sessions in-memory only; backlog item for Phase 2B

## Updated Timeline Snapshot
- DeviceActivity extension & live event wiring: 1–2 days
- Persistence & sync groundwork: 2–3 days
- Reward logic + parental flows: 2–3 days
- Device QA/refinement: 1–2 days

## Summary
Phase 2 now has configurable monitoring that feeds into our data model when DeviceActivity events arrive. Next up: deliver the extension so those events fire for real, add persistence, and layer the reward experience on top.
