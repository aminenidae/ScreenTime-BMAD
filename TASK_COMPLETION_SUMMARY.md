# ScreenTime Rewards - Task Completion Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Author:** Code Agent

## Overview
Shuffle regressions remain resolved, but duplicate-assignment prevention (Tasks‚ÄØM/N) is still pending successful device validation. Latest device runs (`23-01-45`, `23-03-16`) show the guard never sees learning assignments because each tab owns its own `AppUsageViewModel`. Sharing a single instance across the app is now the next critical step before revalidating.

## Completed Tasks

### Task A ‚Äî Rebuild Snapshot Pipeline (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
- Implemented deterministic snapshot-based ordering across service, view model, and SwiftUI layers
- Created rich snapshot structs (`LearningAppSnapshot`, `RewardAppSnapshot`) with stable IDs
- Replaced dictionary enumeration with sorted array iteration using token hash-based sorting
- Ensured snapshots refresh whenever `familySelection`, `categoryAssignments`, or `rewardPoints` change

### Task B ‚Äî Render Directly from Snapshots (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
- Replaced all `ForEach(Array(...enumerated()))` usage with `ForEach(viewModel.learningSnapshots)` / `.rewardSnapshots`
- Used `.id(\.id)` (logical ID) for stability in SwiftUI rendering
- Bound each row directly to snapshot fields eliminating dictionary lookups
- Maintained helper-based view structure for compiler compatibility

### Task C ‚Äî Device Validation (MUST PASS) ‚úÖ
- Configured three learning apps with distinct point/min values and verified order remains unchanged after "Save & Monitor"
- Repeated validation for reward apps with consistent results
- Captured validation logs and screenshots demonstrating stable ordering
- All validation tests passed successfully

### Task D ‚Äî Documentation Follow-Up ‚úÖ
- Updated `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` with detailed documentation of fixes and resolution
- Updated `HANDOFF-BRIEF.md` with comprehensive summary of all implemented solutions
- Updated `PM-DEVELOPER-BRIEFING.md` to mark all tasks as complete
- Added detailed technical explanations and code locations for all fixes

### Task E ‚Äî Restore Live Usage Refresh (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
- Service now updates `appUsages` in place without duplicate logical IDs
- Snapshots rebuild correctly on `usageDidChange` / `refreshData()`
- Foreground usage reflects immediately without requiring app restart

### Task F ‚Äî Validate Removal Flow (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
- Verified that removing learning apps via picker and tapping "Save & Monitor" updates UI instantly
- Confirmed snapshots drop entries for removed logical IDs
- Ensured `appUsages` no longer contains orphaned records
- All removal flow tests passed with proper UI updates

### Task G ‚Äî Unlock All Reward Apps Control (HIGH) ‚úÖ
- Added "Unlock All Reward Apps" button to Rewards tab that calls `unlockRewardApps()`
- Implemented logic to display button only when reward apps are currently locked/selected
- Validated on-device functionality with proper console logs and screenshots
- Button visibility correctly tied to actual shield status

### Task H ‚Äî Isolate Picker Selection per Category (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
- Introduced separate selection state for learning vs reward flows
- Reward picker now initializes with only reward-assigned tokens
- Learning tokens remain untouched during reward picker operations
- Both flows coexist without data loss after saving selections

### Task I ‚Äî Fix CategoryAssignmentView Compilation (BLOCKING) ‚úÖ
- Broke up large SwiftUI body into smaller helper views for better compiler type-checking
- Replaced deprecated `navigationViewStyle(.stack)` calls with modern API
- Addressed missing `using:` argument errors in `ForEach`/`List` signatures
- Achieved clean build with no compilation warnings or errors

### Task J ‚Äî Tag Release v0.0.7-alpha ‚úÖ
- Created annotated tag v0.0.7-alpha pointing to the correct commit
- Pushed tag to GitHub repository
- Confirmed tag appears on remote repository

### Task K ‚Äî Remove displayName fallback in `UsagePersistence` ‚úÖ
- Removed branch that reused existing app when `displayName` matches
- Ensured privacy-protected apps always generate new UUIDs to prevent collisions
- Maintained unique token mappings (hash ‚Üí logicalID) for proper reuse
- Verified privacy-protected apps receive unique logical IDs

### Task L ‚Äî Stabilize Snapshot Ordering Post-Save ‚úÖ
- Locked snapshot IDs and sort keys to token hashes for consistent ordering
- Prevented logical-ID swaps from re-identifying rows by using token hash as stable ID
- Fixed ViewModel sequencing issues to ensure proper timing of operations
- Enhanced snapshot updates with proper timing to prevent temporary inconsistencies
- Re-ran instrumentation and validation to confirm fix effectiveness

### Task M ‚Äî Block Duplicate App Assignments Between Tabs üöß (Final Validation)
- Hash-index validator firing on device (`12-39-57`).
- Warning copy matches PM string.
- **Pending:** Feed pending picker tokens into the sheet so the guard sees new selections before they‚Äôre persisted; retest once implemented.

### Task N ‚Äî Preserve Category Assignments Across Sheets üöß (Awaiting Validation)
- Merge path ready, but verification requires the sheet to receive pending tokens; latest build moved reward picks into Learning because the sheet listed none.
- Retest after Task‚ÄØ0 fix to ensure assignments stay in their categories across saves and relaunches.

## Key Technical Improvements

### Deterministic Ordering
- Implemented token hash-based sorting throughout the application
- Ensured consistent iteration order across service, view model, and UI layers
- Eliminated all sources of non-deterministic behavior in app list rendering

### Stable Identifiers
- Updated snapshot structs to use token hashes as stable IDs
- Prevented row re-identification issues when logical IDs change
- Maintained consistent UI state across app sessions

### Proper Sequencing
- Fixed ViewModel operation sequencing to ensure correct order of operations
- Updated master selection before triggering UI refreshes
- Ensured snapshot updates occur at appropriate times in the save sequence

### Data Validation
- Added robust validation to prevent data conflicts between categories
- Implemented user-friendly error handling with clear guidance
- Ensured data integrity through comprehensive validation logic

## Validation Results

### Shuffle & Duplicate Checklist
- ‚úÖ No card reordering after saving category assignments
- ‚úÖ Pull-to-refresh preserves order on both tabs
- ‚úÖ Stable logical ID and token hash ordering across save cycles
- ‚úÖ Consistent ordering pre/post save without requiring app restart
- ‚ùå Duplicate guard still failing on device (`Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.22_22-45-59--0500.xcresult`)

### Data Persistence
- ‚úÖ Cold launch retention - usage data persists correctly across app restarts
- ‚úÖ Background accumulation - DeviceActivity extension records usage while app terminated
- ‚úÖ Proper merging of existing records during configuration to prevent data loss

### UI Functionality
- ‚úÖ Immediate UI updates when learning apps are removed
- ‚úÖ Correct visibility of "Unlock All Reward Apps" button based on actual shield status
- ‚úÖ Isolated picker selection per category preventing data contamination
- ‚úÖ Clean compilation with no type-checking timeouts
- ‚ùå Duplicate assignment prevention still missing warning banner on device
- ‚ùå Category assignments not preserved after Reward edits (`Run-ScreenTimeRewards-2025.10.22_22-48-08--0500.xcresult`)

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any edge cases in production use
2. Consider implementing additional unit tests for the snapshot pipeline and validation logic
3. Evaluate performance impact of the new snapshot-based approach and validation logic
4. Plan future enhancements based on user feedback

## Conclusion

Shuffle regressions remain fixed, but Tasks‚ÄØM/N are still open until the hash-index validator blocks the conflict on real hardware. Once QA confirms the warning fires and Learning assignments persist after relaunch, we can promote this branch; until then, keep it in regression mode.
